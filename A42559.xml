            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Deſign of this Treatiſe is to ſet forth the State of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Churches, both of the <hi>Popiſh,</hi> and the <hi>Reformed.</hi> As to the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Church in <hi>France,</hi> it is holden to be the beſt Privileged of all the Churches in Chriſtendom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Pope.</p>
            <p>As touching their power, the <hi>Gallican</hi> Clergy ſtands more ſtoutly to their Natural Rights againſt the Encroachments and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> than any other that liveth under the Pope<hi>'s</hi> Authority; which they acknowledge ſo far only, as is conſiſtent with their own Privileges, and the Rights of their Soveraign: for it was long e're they could ſubmit to the Decrees of the Council of <hi>TRENT,</hi> nor have they yet admitted of the Inquiſition.</p>
            <p>The Doctors of the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> are accounted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> the principal Pillars of the <hi>French</hi> Liberty, whereof they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding jealous, as well in matters Eccleſiaſtical as Civil.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:95405:4"/>
            <p>When <hi>Gerſon</hi> Chancellour of <hi>Paris,</hi> had publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed a Book in approbation of the Council of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;</hi> where it was Enacted that the Authority of the Council was greater than that of the Pope, the <hi>Sorbon</hi> Doctors declared that alſo to be their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. For <hi>John Gerſon</hi> in his defence of the Decree of that Council, ſpeaking of the Adverſaries ſaith, <hi>Pernicioſos eſſe admodum adulatores, qui Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem iſtam in Eccleſiam invexere, quaſi nullis Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum teneatur vinculis: quaſi neque parere debeat Concilio Pontifex, nec ab eo judicari queat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Kings themſelves alſo befriend their Clergy in the cauſe, and therefore not only proteſted againſt the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> wherein the Spiritual Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was generally conſented to by the <hi>Popiſh</hi> faction; but <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond King of <hi>France,</hi> would not acknowledge them to be a Council, calling it in his Letters by no other name than <hi>Conventus Tridenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> An indignity which the Fathers took grievouſly.</p>
            <p>Moreover, when King <hi>Lewes</hi> XI. to gratifie Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the ſecond, purpoſed to aboliſh the <hi>Pragmatick Sanction,</hi> the <hi>Sorbonniſts</hi> in behalf of the Church <hi>Gallican,</hi> and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of <hi>Paris, Magnis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtebant animis</hi> (ſaith <hi>Sleidan</hi> in his Commentary) <hi>&amp; a Papâ provocabant ad Concilium.</hi> The Council unto which they appealed, was that of <hi>Baſil,</hi> where that Sanction was made: ſo that by this Appeal they verified their former <hi>Theſis,</hi> that the Council was above the Pope.</p>
            <p>And before the <hi>Pragmatick Sanction</hi> was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Pope had yearly drained the State of a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
<pb facs="tcp:95405:4"/> of Crowns, as the Court of Parliament manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to King <hi>Lewes</hi> the eleventh.</p>
            <p>Since which time the Kings of <hi>France</hi> have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times omitted the vigour of the Sanction, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo exacted it, according as their affairs with the Pope ſtood: therefore it was called <hi>Froenum Pontificum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the Year <hi>1613.</hi> caſually meeting with a Book written by <hi>Becanus,</hi> entituled <hi>Controverſia Anglicana de poteſtate Regis &amp; Papae;</hi> the <hi>French</hi> called an Aſſembly, and condemned it. For, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Main of it was againſt the Power and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy of the King of <hi>England,</hi> yet did it reflect alſo on the Authority of the Pope over the Chriſtians by the <hi>By,</hi> which occaſioned the Sentence. So jealous are they of the leaſt circumſtances, in which any of their immunities may be endangered.</p>
            <p>The Pope hath no power in <hi>France</hi> to pardon cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals.<note place="margin">Le Reſcript. C. de pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cib. Imp. of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. <hi>Gratian.</hi> cauſ. 25.</note> The very faculties of the Legates hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſent into that Kingdom, make not any mention of it, but of the Remiſſion of Sins proceeding from crimes. And though there ſhould be any ſuch thing, yet they are ſtill curbed in with this Bridle.</p>
            <p>To uſe it in ſuch things as are not contrary, dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, nor prejudicial to the Rights and Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the King and Kingdom, nor againſt the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Councils, the Laws of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities, the Liberties of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, and the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Royal.</p>
            <p>The Clergy of <hi>France</hi> do not hold their Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Juriſdiction of the Pope, but of the King
<pb facs="tcp:95405:5"/> alone,<note place="margin">Bellarm. Tom. 1. controv. 2. li. 4. ca. 24.</note> howſoever the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> teach the contrary, when they do not uſe it as they ought: when they connive at the puniſhment of crimes, whereof they have the Cognizance, the Courts of Parliaments may inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by means of an Appeal, as from Abuſes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering, it is it that grants them Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction over Spirituals. And if the Queſtion be of granting pardon to a Prieſt, or other Eccleſiaſtick, not only in a priviledged caſe, but alſo in a common crime by him committed, it belongs to the King only to grant it, not to the Pope, nor the Biſhop. And ſo it hath been always accuſtomed to be done in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, the Pope cannot there reſtore Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to their former State,<note place="margin">Papon. ca. 15. &amp; 16. des libertez. de l'Egliſe. Gallic.</note> ſo as to free them from the infamy which they have incurred; nor Lay-men unleſs it be to receive them into Orders, Offices, and Eccleſiaſtical Acts, not otherwiſe. As alſo that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Realm, he cannot pardon or remit the <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Amends,</hi> adjudged by a Lay-man, albeit the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation were paſſed by an Eccleſiastical Judge, and that against a Clerk, as making ſuch Honorary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation a part of the civil ſatiſfaction.</p>
            <p>The Pope cannot make any <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nions, or annexations of the livings in <hi>France,</hi> during the life of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbents, nor at other times: but he may grant out Writs of Delegation concerning unions, which is conceived to be done, according to the form preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Patron, and not otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>The Kings of <hi>France</hi> have always reſerved this authority and prerogative to themſelves, to determine
<pb facs="tcp:95405:5"/> of the Reſidence of Biſhops, to compel them to feed their Flocks, and wait upon their Churches when need required, and that by ſeizing upon their Temporals; to call them from <hi>Rome</hi> to return into <hi>France,</hi> to diſpenſe with them, and approve the cauſes of their abſence.</p>
            <p>The Pope cannot in <hi>France</hi> diſpenſe for any cauſe whatſoever, with that which is of the Law of God or Nature, or with that wherein the Councils do not allow him to diſpenſe. And the Ordinances of the <hi>French</hi> Kings do expreſly forbid all the Judges of the Land to have any regard <hi>to diſpenſations grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed contrary to the ſacred Decrees and Councils, upon pain of loſing their places:</hi> And declare fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, <hi>That ſuch as procure the ſaid Proviſo's and diſpenſations, ſhall not make uſe of them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they get leave and permiſſion from his Majeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Gallican</hi> Church is alſo more free from pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the Pope than the Church of <hi>Spain,</hi> as alſo to the King. The Clergy of <hi>France</hi> pay only the <hi>Diſme;</hi> whereas in <hi>Spain</hi> the King hath his <hi>Terti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a's, Subſidio, Pyla, Eſcuſado;</hi> in all a moiety of the Church-livings.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>French</hi> Churches ſeparating from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they have often been brought very low by the <hi>Popiſh</hi> party.</p>
            <p>Sad was the condition of the Church of <hi>Merin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol,</hi> which was cruelly rooted out by vertue of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of the Parliament of <hi>Aix,</hi> Men, Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren being deſtroyed.

It was eaſie for him in thoſe times of darkneſs to draw multitudes of poor blind Souls to Deſtruction. And <hi>Reimond,</hi> Earl of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> a great Prince, and Peer of <hi>France,</hi> was ruined, the Pope ſeizing on his Eſtate and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it unto this day.</p>
            <p>A <hi>French</hi> Hiſtorian ſpeaking of the bloody maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> IX. ſaith,<note place="margin">Thuan. Hiſt. li. 54.</note> that many wiſe men that were Papiſts themſelves, did think, that in all Antiquity there could not be found an example of like cruelty. But even then remarkable was God's Providence towards thoſe of the Reformed Religion in <hi>France.</hi> In the time of that cruel maſſacre at <hi>Paris</hi> the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> being in great fear ſhifted for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves here and there. Among the reſt many of them
<pb facs="tcp:95405:6"/> fled to a certain honourable Lady for protection, who being near of kin to the King, was the more bold: but being a faithful Chriſtian, ſhe was alſo willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them.</p>
            <p>Hereof complaint being made, the King in great diſpleaſure commands her to diſmiſs them all, which ſhe could not withſtand: ſo that in one day about <hi>300</hi> Waggons (for the moſt part filled with Women and young Children) were conſtrained to diſlodge, and without a guard to go to a ſtrong Town for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their lives. In this Journey they were to paſs through their bloody enemies ſtragling up and down in Armes, and ready to ſeize on ſuch a booty. But by the ſpecial providence of God, a certain Troop of Armed Gentlemen on Horſe-back hapned to meet them, who ſoon perceiving and pitying their danger, conducted them along in ſafety, and often repulſed their enemies that were ready to aſſail them. And though the <hi>French</hi> Kings (have all of them) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, yet the Lord hath had many Inſtruments, who with the hazard of their lives, and outward Eſtates, have ſtood for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his Church, divers Princes of the Blood, Nobles, Gentlemen and others, and did ſtrangely raiſe his Church again after that horrid maſſacre, by which it ſeemed to have been extinguiſhed.</p>
            <p>And King <hi>James</hi> of happy Memory, ſpeaketh thus of thoſe worthy Patriots whom God raiſed up for the defence of his Church at that time, in his book of the defence of the right of Kings. I never knew yet (ſaith he) that the <hi>French Proteſtants</hi> took Arms against
<pb facs="tcp:95405:7"/> their King. In the firſt troubles they ſtood only on their defence. Before they took Arms they were burnt and maſſacred every where. And the quarrel did not begin for Religion: but becauſe when King <hi>Francis</hi> the ſecond was under Age, they had been the Refuge of the Princes of the Blood expelled from the Court, even of the Grandfather of the King now reigning, and of that of the Prince of <hi>Condè,</hi> who knew not where to take Sanctuary, it ſhall not be found that they made any other War. Nay is it not true (as a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Divine of ours hath well obſerved) that King <hi>Henry</hi> III. ſent Armies againſt them to deſtroy them, and yet they ran to his help as ſoon as they ſaw him in danger? Is it not true, that they ſaved his Life at <hi>Tours;</hi> and delivered him from extream danger? And in the Year <hi>1617.</hi> they had the Teſtimony of their fidelity from their own King <hi>Lewes</hi> XIII. written to their Deputies aſſembled in a Synod at <hi>Vitre</hi> in theſe terms. We have received with good ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction the new aſſurances and proteſtations which you have made unto us of your fidelity &amp; obedience, in the which if you perſiſt, as ye ought, and as ye have done before, you may alſo be aſſured, that we ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have a care to maintain and preſerve you in all the advantages which have been granted unto you.</p>
            <p>A Reverend Divine on the <hi>Revelation,</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>French</hi> Churches ſaith; God hath made the Church of <hi>France</hi> a wonder (to me) in his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing toward them from firſt to laſt, and therefore to me great and ſpecial honour would ſeem to be reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for them yet at the laſt. For the firſt light of the
<pb facs="tcp:95405:7"/> Goſpel, the firſt and ſecond Angels preaching, <hi>(Rev. 14.)</hi> which laid the Foundation of Antichrist's ruine, was from them, namely thoſe of <hi>Lyons,</hi> and other places in <hi>France:</hi> and they bare the heat of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was as great as any ſince, if not greater. Moreover, the Churches of <hi>France</hi> have ever ſince had as great a ſhare in perſecutions, yea greater than any of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Churches. And although it be well nigh five hundred years ſince they began to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate firſt from Antichriſt, yet they never had the great honour and priviledge (which other Churches have been ſo bleſt with) as to have a ſupream Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, profeſſing their Religion, except one, who alſo continued not therein.</p>
            <p>

               <note place="margin">Paraei. Com. in 17. Apoc.

               <hi>Ex Natione Illuſtriſſimi Lilii orietur Rexqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> &amp;c. There ſhall ariſe a King out of the Nation of the moſt illuſtrious Lily (viz. <hi>France</hi>) having a long forehead, high brows, great eyes, and an Eagle's noſe. He ſhall gather a great Army, and destroy all the Tyrants of his Kingdom, and ſlay all that fly, and hide themſelves in the Mountains and Caves from his face. For Righteouſneſs ſhall be joyned unto him as the Bridegroom to the Bride: with them He ſhall wage War, even to the fortyeth year, bringing into ſubjection the <hi>Iſlanders, Spaniards,</hi> and <hi>Italians:
<pb facs="tcp:95405:8"/> Rome</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi> he ſhall deſtroy and burn with fire, ſo as ſalt may be ſowed on that Land. The greateſt Clergy who have invaded St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s ſeat, he ſhall put to death, and in the ſame year obtain a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Crown: and at laſt going over Sea with a great Army, he ſhall enter <hi>Greece,</hi> and be named King of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Barbarians</hi> he ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due, making an Edict, <hi>That every one ſhall dye the death, that worſhippeth not the crucified one:</hi> and none ſhall be found able to reſiſt him, becauſe an holy Arm from the Lord ſhall always be with him, and He ſhall poſſeſs the Dominion of the Earth. Theſe things being done, he ſhall be called, The rest of Holy Chriſtians. Thus far the Prophecy, which every one may credit ſo far as it likes him, ſaith my Authour.</p>
            <p>There is another common Prophecy, <hi>viz.

               <p>The like may be affirmed, (but on ſurer grounds) of <hi>Trophimus,</hi> ſaid to be the firſt paſtor, or Biſhop of <hi>Arles.</hi> For, afterwards in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie betwixt the Archbiſhops of <hi>Vienna</hi> in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Arles,</hi> for the Dignity of Metropolitan, in the time of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the firſt, it was thus pleaded in behalf of the Biſhop of <hi>Arles, Quod prima inter Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias,</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:95405:9"/> &amp;c.

               <p>In the Hiſtory of <hi>Lazarus</hi> and <hi>Maximinus,</hi> we find, that they with <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and her ſiſter <hi>Martha</hi> came to <hi>Marſeilles.

The French Antiquities tell us, That after the Aſcenſion of our Lord, <hi>Anno</hi> 14. the Jews raiſed ſo horrible a perſecution againſt the Chriſtians, that the moſt part fled whither they could: That <hi>Maximinus</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with <hi>Lazarus,</hi> took <hi>Mary Magdalen, Martha, Marcella</hi> her hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, and ſome others, and committing themſelves to the Sea to avoid the fury of the Jews, they arrive at <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> where the Prince of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles</hi> was baptized. <hi>Lazarus</hi> became firſt Paſtor of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> and <hi>Maximinus</hi> of <hi>Aquens.</hi> They were ordained to thoſe Churches in the Year of Chriſt, 46. in which Year theſe Authors tell us, that <hi>Simon</hi> the Leper (whom our Saviour cured of that infirmity) was Ordained to be Miniſter of <hi>Mentz, Cenomanenſium</hi> in the Latin.</p>

               <p>Having premiſed certain things by way of preamble, they proceed in theſe words.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95405:10"/> confeſſed it with a loud voice, and ſo was received into the fellowſhip of the Martyrs, and called <hi>the Advocate of the Chriſtians.</hi> Then they declare, that Ten weak Chriſtians, not able to bear the burden of ſo weighty a combate fell in time of Perſecution, to their great heavineſs, and ſorrowful lamentation. They add, that out of both theſe Churches as many as ruled and bare the greateſt ſway, were taken and executed. Great was the whole rage both of Preſident, People, and Soldiers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Sanctus,</hi> Deacon of the Church of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and againſt <hi>Maturus,</hi> lately Baptized, yet a notable warriour, and againſt <hi>Attalus</hi> a man of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> who was a Pillar of the Faith, and againſt <hi>Blandina,</hi> who at the time of her anſwer was ſo repleniſhed with Grace from Above, that the Executioners which tormented her by turns from morning to night, fainted for wearineſs, and ceaſed, confeſſing themſelves over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, marvelling that as yet ſhe drew breath, having her whole body rent in pieces, and the wounds open; they confeſſing withal, that one of theſe Torments was of force ſufficient to coſt <hi>Her</hi> her life, much more ſo many and ſo great ſufferings: But this Bleſſed Woman like a Noble Wreſtler, was renewed at her Confeſſion; for as oft as ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, <hi>I am a Chriſtian, neither have we committed any evil:</hi> She was refreſhed, and felt no pain of her puniſhment. And ſuch was the conſtancy of <hi>Sanctus,</hi> that in the midſt of his Torments, he uttered neither his own Name, neither his Kindred, nor the Countrey whence he was, but unto every Queſtion he anſwered in the Roman Tongue, <hi>I am a Chriſtian:</hi> Thus confeſſed he often, neither could the Gentiles get any other Language of him. When the wicked Tormentors a few dayes after had brought him to the place of Torment, and well hoped, that if they puniſhed him now (having his whole body pufft up with ſwelling and feſtered wounds, ſo ſore that it might not be touched, no not with the leaſt finger) they ſhould overcome him, or that if he died in torment, they ſhould terrifie the reſt; none of all theſe happened unto him, but beyond all mens expectation, his body was releaſed of the pain, recovered it's former ſhape, and the members were reſtored to their former uſe.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Biblis,</hi> a Woman, was grievouſly tormented, who in the midſt of her Torments, cryed out unto the Tormentors, and ſaid, How could they devour Infants, which were not ſuffered to ſuck the blood of brute Beaſts?

               <p>
                  <hi>Maturus, Sanctus, Blandina</hi> and <hi>Attalus,</hi> were led unto the brute beaſts in the publick ſpectacle of the Heathens. <hi>Maturus</hi> and <hi>Sanctus</hi> were diverſly Tormented with all kinds of puniſhments, as if they had ſuffered nothing before: At length, after they had endured this grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Tryal, they were beheaded. <hi>Blandina</hi> was hanged in chains on a Gibbet ſo low, that the wild beaſts might reach her: after that ſhe had hung a long while, and no Beaſt touched her, ſhe was taken down, caſt into priſon, and reſerved for further Torment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Attalus</hi> alſo a Famous Man, and notably exerciſed in the Chriſtian Profeſſion, was led within compaſs of the Theatre with a Scroll be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, wherein was written in the Roman Tongue, <hi>This is Attalus the Chriſtian.</hi> The Preſident knowing that he was a Roman, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to be impriſoned, and cloſely kept with the other priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, concerning whom he had written unto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and expected an Anſwer.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Attalus</hi> was fryed to death in a ſcalding Iron Chair, ſo that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his broiled body filled their noſtrils; who being demanded what Name God had, Anſwered, <hi>God is not called after the manner of Men.</hi>

                  <hi>Blandina,</hi> together with <hi>Ponticus</hi> (a youth of fifteen years of Age) was brought forth, whom they would have compelled to ſwear by their Idol's Name: But they contemning their Idol, the multitude were enraged againſt them, tormenting them with all manner of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments. <hi>Ponticus</hi> being comforted and confirmed by <hi>Blandina</hi> in preſence of the Pagans, after he had ſuffered moſt exquiſite Torments yielded up the Ghoſt. Laſt of all, <hi>Blandina</hi> like a noble Mother, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exhorted her Children, and ſent them before as Conquerours unto the King, pondering with her ſelf all the puniſhments of her Children,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95405:11"/> haſtened after them, joying and triumphing at her end, as if ſhe had been invited, and going to a wedding dinner: After ſcourging, after combating with wild Beaſts, after the broiling of her body as it were in a frying-pan, at length ſhe was wrapped in a Net, and tumbled before a wild Bull, which fanned and toſſed her on his horns to and fro, yet had ſhe no feeling thereof, in the end ſhe was beheaded; the Pagans themſelves pronouncing, That never any Woman among them was heard to have ſuffered ſo many, and ſo great Torments.</p>
               <p>As many as were choked with the noiſom ſtench of the priſon, were thrown to be devoured of Dogs, the Pagans keeping a watch day and night, that none of them might be buried by their Friends. To be ſhort, after that the bodies of the bleſſed Saints had been every kind of way ſpitefully and ſcornfully entreated, lying ſix whole dayes unbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, at length they were burned to aſhes, the aſhes alſo they gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, and ſcattered in the River <hi>Rhodanus</hi> which paſſed by, ſo that no jot or relique thereof ſhould any longer remain upon the earth.

                  <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſheweth, how unto his time Miracles were wrought by the faithful: ſome (ſaith he) do ſoundly and truly caſt out Devils, others have the foreknowledge of things to come, they ſee Divine Dreams, and Prophetical Viſions; others cure the diſeaſed, and reſtore them to health by their laying on of hands. The dead were raiſed to life (ſaith he) and lived together with us many years. Again, in another place, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> thus writeth, We have heard of many Brethren in the Church which had the gift of propheſying, which were able through the Holy Ghoſt to ſpeak with ſundry Tongues,<note place="margin">Iren. Lib. 5.</note> which could reveil the ſecrets of men where it ſo behoved, and expound the dark myſteries of God.</p>
               <p>Then aroſe a Controverſie about the keeping of <hi>Eaſter;</hi> for the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95405:11"/> Church of the Weſt, and part of that of the Eaſt did Celebrate the Feaſt of Eaſter upon the Lord's day: but part of the Church of the Eaſt did Celebrate it upon the fourteenth day of the Moon of <hi>March,</hi> not looking for the Lord's day. Towards the end of this ſecond Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, <hi>Victor,</hi> the ſucceſſour of <hi>Eleutherius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> took that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs in hand with eagerneſs, and for that cauſe ſeparated the Oriental Churches from his Communion. <hi>Polycrates</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus</hi> reſiſted him; <hi>Victor</hi> being incenſed with that reſiſtance, excommunicateth all the Eaſtern Churches. <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaith, That this did not pleaſe all the Biſhops, wherefore alſo they made him a contrary Command, that he ſhould keep Peace, Union and Charity with his Neighbours. Among other Examples he brings forth the Epiſtle of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> to <hi>Victor,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he accuſeth him to have violated Charity, and to have departed from the Example of his Anceſtors. <hi>Ruffinus</hi> relateth the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Euſebius</hi> makes mention of what <hi>Irenaeus</hi> wrote concerning the Holy Canonical Scriptures, and the tranſlation of the <hi>Septuagint. Irenaeus</hi> wrote divers Epiſtles to confute ſuch as at <hi>Rome</hi> corrupted the ſincere Rites of the Church: He wrote one to <hi>Blaſtus</hi> of Schiſm, another to <hi>Florinus</hi> of Monarchy, or ſhewing that God is not the Author of Evil, which Opinion <hi>Florinus</hi> ſeemed to be of, but afterwards he was ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with the Errour of <hi>Valentinus. Irenaeus</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Florinus,</hi> Reporteth, that he had converſed with <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> ſo that he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the place where <hi>Polycarpus</hi> ſate when he taught, his courſe of Life, the figure and proportion of his body, the Sermons he made unto the Multitude, the report he made of his Converſation with St. <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle, and others which ſaw the Lord; how he remembred their ſayings, and what he heard out of their mouths touching the Lord, of his Power and Doctrine. Theſe things (ſaith he) I diligently marked and printed them in my heart: And I am able to teſtifie, if that Holy and Apoſtolick Elder had heard any ſuch thing, he would have preſently ſtopped his ears, and reclaimed it. To be ſhort, this may be reported for true out of the Epiſtles which he wrote for the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bordering Churches, or out of the Epiſtles which he wrote to certain Brethren for Admonition or Exhortation-ſake. Thus far <hi>Irenaeus.</hi>

               <p>There are but few of the Fathers but have ſome particular Opinion which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> diſalloweth as well as we.

The ſame Father alſo Teacheth, that the Souls ſeparated from the bodies have a bodily ſhape, and keep the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter or form of the body to which they were joyned.

                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:95405:12"/> ſaith,<note place="margin">Iren.

The ſame Father in the Fifth Book, <hi>Chap.</hi> 33 and 34 brings in bodily Feaſts after the Reſurrection, becauſe Chriſt ſaid, He ſhould drink of the New Fruit of the Vine in the Kingdom of his Father. The ſame Father oppoſeth them as Hereticks, that hold that the Souls of the Faithful departed do enjoy the Heavenly Glory. His Opinion was, that at their going out of the Body, they go down into an inviſible place where they expect the Reſurrection.</p>

He ſuffered his Wife likewiſe to Baptize her Children.<note place="margin">Cauſins Holy Court. <hi>Part.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Clotilda</hi> deſired nothing more than the Converſion of her Husband, which happened in this ſort: The <hi>Suevi,</hi> a people of <hi>Germany,</hi> paſſed the <hi>Rhine</hi> with great Forces, Commanded by many Kings, who were perſonally in the Army, and came to ruſh on the <hi>Gauls,</hi> with intentions to deſtroy the beginnings of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy: <hi>Clovis</hi> ſpeedily oppoſeth them with good Troops, for he likewiſe had drawn together to his Aid the <hi>Ribarols,</hi> people near bordering on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> who were Allied to the <hi>French,</hi> and had firſt of all given notice of the Enterprize of the <hi>Suevi,</hi> who in a near degree threatned them.</p>
               <p>The encounter of the two Armies was near <hi>Colen,</hi> which was one of the moſt deſperate that we find in Hiſtories. The King undertook the Conduct of the Cavalry, and had given unto Prince <hi>Sigebert</hi> his Kinſman, the Infantry: There was nothing but fire, tempeſts, deaths, and ſlaughters, ſo great was the reſiſtance on either ſide: In the end <hi>Sigebert</hi> valiantly fighting, was wounded with an arrow, and born all bloody out of the battel by his Son. The Infantry (through the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of their Colonel) was defeated and put to rout. All the burden of the battel fell upon the Cavalry, which did great exploits, fighting before the eyes of their King; but in the end, the ſhock of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies was ſo impetuous, that it brake through and ſcattered them. <hi>Clovis</hi> covered with blood and duſt, performed the duty both of a great Captain and valiant Soldier; but notwithſtanding all his endeavours, terrour had ſo ſeized on theſe flying men, that his affairs grew deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate: Hereupon <hi>Aurelianus,</hi> the Kings great Favourite, perſwadeth him to make a vow unto God to be Baptized, if he returned victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous from this battel; which he did, calling aloud upon the God of his Wife, and promiſing an abſolute Converſion to the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
               <p>The word was no ſooner ſpoken, but that his Troops rallied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up, made head againſt their enemies, purſued them, ran through and routed them with ſo great a maſſacre, that the fields were all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with dead bodies: The diſcomfiture ſo terrified them on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> that the <hi>Almans</hi> which ſurvived yielded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves tributaries to his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clotilda</hi> hearing the news of this victory, and of the King's pious Reſolution, went out to meet him as far as <hi>Champagne,</hi> accompanied with <hi>Remigius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> a man of great Piety and Eloquence to inſtruct him in the true Doctrine, wherein he was very ignorant.<note place="margin">De Serres Hiſt. in Vit.

               <p>The preaching of <hi>Remigius</hi> was effectual with <hi>Clovis,</hi> and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Clovis</hi> with his men of war: When he came to the Church of <hi>Rhemes</hi> to be Baptized, <hi>Remigius</hi> ſpake to him theſe words, <hi>Bend thy neck to the yoke in mildneſs, worſhip that which thou haſt burnt, and burn that which thou haſt worſhipped:</hi> He Anſwered, <hi>I worſhip the true God, which is the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, the Creator of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth.</hi> The King being Baptized, exhorted his men to the ſame belief; they cry all joyntly, <hi>We leave our Mortal Gods, and are ready to follow the Immortal.</hi> So <hi>Clovis</hi> was baptized at <hi>Rhemes</hi> by <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migius,</hi> and with him three thouſand of his Soldiers, to the incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible joy of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> greatly affected to Chriſtian Religion; and this perfected the union betwixt them and the <hi>French,</hi> making their yoke eaſie, and them tractable.</p>
               <p>The firſt War he undertook after his Baptiſm, was againſt <hi>Gombaut</hi> King of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> who being vanquiſhed became Tributary to <hi>Clovis. Gombaut</hi> was an <hi>Arian,</hi> and this his Hereſie drew upon him the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God. Afterwards <hi>Clovis</hi> encountred with the Forces of <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus</hi> in <hi>Aquitain,</hi> diſcomfiteth them, and kills <hi>Alaricus.</hi> The hand of God thundred and lightened at that time upon many Diadems of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical Kings, <hi>viz.

               <p>
                  <hi>Remigius</hi> was a man of moſt holy Converſation, and beſides his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable ſanctity, acknowledged throughout all <hi>France,</hi> he had the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to be one of the moſt able and eloquent men of his time; witneſs <hi>Sidonius Apollinarius,</hi> who ſpeaking of his eloquence with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, ſaith, He thought there was not a man living upon the face of the earth, whom <hi>Remigius</hi> ſurpaſſeth not, without any elaborate ſtudy at all, through the experience he had acquired of well-ſpeaking: his conceptions were unimitable, his language ſo ſweet and polite, that it reſembled a very ſmooth piece of ice, whereon nothing might be ſeen unequal: His ſentences were full of weight, his arguments forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and his words glided along like a river, and ever bare in them ſome flaſhes of lightning at the end of his periods: He was a very learned man, as by the Commentaries which he wrote upon the Old and New Teſtament evidently appeareth.</p>

               <p>In the ſecond Council Simony is condemned, and the receiving of money for the admitting a man to a Spiritual Office is condemned.</p>
               <p>In the third Council Perjury is abhorred in a man having a Spiritual Calling, but ſoftly puniſhed by two years, excluding him from the Communion.</p>

               <p>There was an heap of Conſtitutions about the keeping of Lent and Eaſter, about the prohibition of Marriage betwixt Chriſtians and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted Jews, about Servants not to be admitted to Eccleſiaſtical Orders; about Aſſemblies to be (at the leaſt) yearly Convocated by Biſhops, about Eccleſiaſtical Rents not to be dilapidated.</p>

               <p>It was alſo Ordained, that a Biſhop ſhould count his Wife as his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and that he ſhould no manner of way company with her, and for this cauſe ſhould have Presbyters and Deacons ſo familiarly converſant with him, that they might bear teſtimony of his honeſt behaviour, <hi>viz.</hi> that he never companied with his Wife. The Papiſts themſelves could not overpaſs this Canon without a cenſure.</p>
               <p>Moreover it was Ordained, That no Prieſt or Monk ſhould receive in bed with him another Prieſt or Monk, to the end they might be ſo unreprovable, that they would abſtain from all appearance of evil.</p>
               <p>In this Council were ſet down very ſtrict prohibitions, that no man

               <p>A Council likewiſe was holden at <hi>Paris,</hi> wherein order was taken concerning admitting of Biſhops to their Offices, That no man ſhould be admitted Biſhop without the full conſent of Clergy and People, and that no man ſhould preſume by favour of Princes only, without the conſents aforeſaid, to become Biſhop in any place.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Clotaire</hi> remained alone King of <hi>France,</hi> his Brethren being dead, their Children alſo were dead, and <hi>Childebert</hi> the eldeſt died without Iſſue. The Reign of <hi>Clotaire</hi> was ſhort and wretched; He ſought to extort the thirds of all Eccleſiaſtical Things to his private Affairs: but the Clergy oppoſed themſelves againſt him, ſo as threats prevailed not. He dies <hi>Anno</hi> 567.</p>
               <p>Before that he Rules as King alone, he Erected the little Realm of <hi>Yvetot</hi> upon this occaſion. Upon good Fryday he ſlew <hi>Gawter</hi> of <hi>Yve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tot</hi> his Servant in the Chappel where he heard Service. It is ſaid, that the King had raviſhed his Wife lodging in his houſe, ſo as he that was beaten ſuffered the puniſhment. Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> diſpleaſed with this infamous murther, condemned him to repair the fault upon pain of Excommunication: <hi>Clotaire</hi> for ſatisfaction Ordaineth, That from thenceforth the Lords of <hi>Yvetot</hi> ſhould be free from all homage, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and obedience to the King for the Land of <hi>Yvetot</hi> in the Countrey of <hi>Normandy:</hi> And ſo this ſmall ſeigneury hath continued long with the Title and Prerogative of a Realm, until that this Title of a Realm was changed into a Principality, the which the houſe of <hi>Bellay</hi> doth now enjoy. <hi>Clotaire</hi> had by two Wives five Sons and one Daughter; four ſurvived him, <hi>viz. Cherebert, Chilperic, Sigebert, Gonthran</hi> and <hi>Cloſinde</hi> his Daughter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cherebert</hi> was King of <hi>France, Chilperic</hi> King of <hi>Soiſſons, Gonthran</hi> King of <hi>Orleans, Sigibert</hi> King of <hi>Metz</hi> or <hi>Lorain,</hi> although each of them called himſelf King of <hi>France,</hi> and commanded abſolutely over the Countries under their obedience: All of them Reigned together fifteen years.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Council of <hi>Matiſcon</hi> was convened in the twenty fourth year of King <hi>Gunthran:</hi> In it complaint was made, that Baptiſm uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally was miniſtred on every holy day, inſomuch that upon Eaſter day ſcarce were two or three found to be preſented to Baptiſm: This they Ordained to be amended, and that no man (except upon occaſion of infirmity) preſume to preſent his Child to Baptiſm, but to attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Feſtival dayes preſcribed of old, that is, Eaſter and Whitſunday.</p>
               <p>Alſo it was Appointed and Ordained, that the Sacrament of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar ſhould be Adminiſtred before any of the Communicants had taſted of meat or drink.</p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:95405:20"/>
               <p>That no perſon who fleeth to the Church, as to a City of Refuge, ſhould be drawn back again by violence from the boſome of the Church, or be harmed in that holy place.</p>
               <p>That a Biſhop ſhall not be attached before a Secular Judge.</p>
               <p>That the Houſes of Biſhops ſhall be kept holy with exerciſes of prayer and ſinging of Pſalms, and ſhall not be defiled with the bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of dogs, and muting of Hawks.</p>
               <p>That Secular men ſhall do reverence to thoſe of the Clergy, even unto the loweſt degree of them; in ſuch ſort, that if the Secular Man do meet any of the Clergy walking on foot, he ſhall honour him by uncovering his head: But if the Secular man be riding on horſeback, and the Clergy-man on foot, then the Secular man ſhall light down from his horſe, and ſhall do reverence to the Church-man.</p>
               <p>In the third Council at <hi>Matiſcon,</hi> we read of nothing but a conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious diſputation between two Biſhops, <hi>Palladius</hi> and <hi>Bertram,</hi> and fooliſh queſtions ſcarce fit to be diſputed in Grammar-Schools.</p>

               <p>But it was not long before the Popes became the great Patrons of the adoration of Images, and made it a means of their riſing; for when the Greek Emperours fell to the breaking of Images, <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond took thence occaſion to ſhake off the yoke of the Emperours, as enemies of the Saints,<note place="margin">Sigon. <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. de regno Ital.</note> and made <hi>Rome</hi> and part of <hi>Italy</hi> to revolt from the Obedience of their Soveraign: And he made himſelf a Temporal Prince, under colour of defending Images, as <hi>Sigonius</hi> relateth.</p>

               </p>
               <p>In this Century <hi>Rupertus</hi> Biſhop of the <hi>Francks,</hi> with twelve other Divines came into the Country of the <hi>Boii,</hi> and there <hi>Rupertus,</hi> by preaching the Goſpel, converted <hi>Theodon</hi> the Prince of the Countrey,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95405:22"/> with his Son, from Heatheniſh Idolatry unto Chriſt, and baptized them both at <hi>Ratisbon:</hi> Many others alſo were converted by him.</p>
               <p>In this Age flouriſhed <hi>German</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> forementioned.<note place="margin">Oſiand. Eccleſ.

Not long after the Biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> dying, he was Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Biſhop there by King <hi>Childebert.</hi> With ſingular zeal he provoked the People to Godlineſs; great was his gravity in preaching, and his words were weighty and powerful; he was liberal towards the poor, and redeemed many Captives. King <hi>Chilperic</hi> after his death (who was wont to deride and contemn other Miniſters) wrote this honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Epitaph upon him, which I thought fit to ſet down: <q>
                     <l>Eccleſiae ſpeculum, patriae vigor, ara reorum:</l>
                     <l>Et pater, &amp; medicus, paſtor amorque gregis.</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The Hiſtories of this Age make mention of one <hi>Etius</hi> Arch-Deacon of the Church of <hi>Paris,</hi> who when he underſtood that Innocent <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>textatus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rhothomagum</hi> (accuſed of Treaſon againſt the King) was in danger to be condemned in a Synod at <hi>Paris,</hi> he with great bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs entred into the Synod, and admoniſhed the Biſhops and Aſſeſſours, to beware of having an hand in the condemning of an Innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he told them they ought rather to reprove King <hi>Chilperic</hi> for his ſins.</p>
               <p>In the Reign of this King many Jews were baptized in <hi>France,</hi> but many of them returned to their vomit, and perfidiouſly renounced the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p>In thoſe dayes there were great inundations of waters, which did much hurt in many places, eſpecially at <hi>Lions,</hi> where part of the walls of that City were thrown down. Horrible earthquakes made great concuſſions in part of <hi>France,</hi> and overturned ſome mountains toward <hi>Spain,</hi> which overwhelmed many men and beaſts. A fire falling from Heaven conſumed the City of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and the ſtreets of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> together with the fruits of the earth. Other places were ſorely afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a grievous hail. There followed almoſt through all <hi>France</hi> a malignant Cough and bloody Flux, which deſtroyed very many men and women; by which diſeaſe that wicked <hi>Auſtigildis,</hi> Wife of King <hi>Gunthran</hi> periſhed. The cauſe of theſe evils was ſaid to be the diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, civil wars, and horrible impieties of thoſe three Brothers fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, <hi>Sigebert, Chilperic,</hi> and <hi>Gunthran,</hi> Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and their Counſellours and Miniſters, who provoked them to thoſe impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95405:23"/> who were puniſhed of God for their flagitious practices with moſt grievous judgements.</p>
               <p>Here I ſhall make mention of the various fortune of <hi>Theodorus</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Marſeilles</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Childebert, Divamius</hi> (a moſt wicked man) being Governour of that Province: This man hated <hi>Theodorus,</hi> and laid divers ſnares to entrap him. And when <hi>Theodorus</hi> was going to King <hi>Childebert</hi> to implore his help, he was ſeized on by <hi>Divamius</hi> in the midſt of the City of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> and injuriouſly dealt with, and ſo diſmiſſed. In his journey <hi>Theodorus,</hi> by the inſtigation of <hi>Divamius,</hi> is taken by <hi>Gunthran</hi> King of <hi>Orleans:</hi> then the Clergy of <hi>Marſeilles</hi> being no better than <hi>Divamius,</hi> being very joyful at the news of it, do immediately invade and plunder all the ſubſtance and treaſures of the Church, and load <hi>Theodorus</hi> with divers calumnies. King <hi>Chilperic</hi> ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <hi>Theodorus</hi> at liberty, and ſendeth him back with <hi>Gundulphus</hi> the Governour to <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> that there he might be reſtored to his former dignity. At the coming of <hi>Gundulphus</hi> and <hi>Theodorus, Divamius</hi> and the Clergy do ſhut the gates, and drive them back reproachfully. But <hi>Gundulphus</hi> by Art getting into the City with his Soldiers, ſoon brake the power of <hi>Divamius,</hi> and ſharply rebuked him; yet <hi>Gundulphus</hi> being appeaſed with deprecations and gifts, <hi>Divamius</hi> having taken an oath that he would reſtore <hi>Theodorus</hi> to his Biſhoprick, and for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be faithful to the King, he returned to his houſe.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Divamius</hi> deſpiſing his Oath, ſignifieth the reſtitution of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> to King <hi>Gunthran,</hi> adding, That while <hi>Theodorus</hi> held his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, King <hi>Gunthran</hi> could never enjoy the City of <hi>Marſeilles. Gunthran</hi> being angry ſendeth Soldiers to take <hi>Theodorus,</hi> who ſeizing upon the Biſhop unexpectedly, they carry him on horſeback bound with chains moſt ignominiouſly to their King: But King <hi>Gunthran</hi> knowing the innocency of <hi>Theodorus,</hi> without doing him any harm ſuffers him to return to his charge, beſtowing many gifts upon him. Upon this occaſion great enmity grew between King <hi>Gunthran</hi> and <hi>Childebert:</hi> Many other calumnies, and grievous indignities did this innocent Biſhop ſuffer from other of his wicked and malicious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. About that time <hi>Mundericus, Epiſcopus Ternoderenſis,</hi> being by force taken away from his Church, is thruſt into a cloſe and ſtrong Tower built upon the bank of the River <hi>Rhodanus,</hi> and there was detained almoſt two years, and moſt grievouſly handled.</p>
               <p>Under the Juriſdiction of <hi>Gregory</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Tours,</hi> there was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Presbyter who denied the Reſurrection of the Body. The fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Gregory</hi> diſputed againſt him, which diſputation you may read at large in the <hi>Magdeburgenſian</hi> Hiſtory.

                  <hi>Phocas,</hi> a mean Captain in <hi>Thracia,</hi> in a ſedition of the people did kill his Soveraign <hi>Mauritius</hi> the Emperour, uſurped the Crown, and held the Empire ſeven years.

               <p>
                  <hi>Gregory</hi> deviſed many new Rites, yet tied not others to follow them: For when <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (whom he ſent into <hi>Britain</hi>) demanded of him, ſeeing the Faith is one, why are the cuſtomes of the Church divers? and why is one ſort of Maſs in <hi>Rome,</hi> and another in <hi>France?

               <p>In <hi>France</hi> the two Sons of <hi>Childebert, Teodorick</hi> and <hi>Theodebert</hi> (their Grandmother <hi>Brunehault</hi> working that thing) reigned with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual diſagreement among themſelves, and with <hi>Clotharius.

                  <hi>Clotharius</hi> ſeeing himſelf King of ſo great a Monarchy, after a long and horrible confuſion of inteſtine wars, uſed all diligence to pacifie the Realm. He augmented the great Authority of the Maires of the Palace, who controlled Kings, and in the end uſurped the Royalty, whereas they were before but Controllers of the King's Houſe, not of the Realm. He had one only Son, whoſe name was <hi>Dagobert:</hi> He committed him to <hi>Arnulph</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Metz,</hi> a learned and good man to be inſtructed by him.</p>

                  <hi>Clotharius</hi> dieth in the year 631. having Governed 44 years from his cradle, and paſſed happily through many perillous difficulties: He left his Son <hi>Dagobert</hi> for his Succeſſour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dagobert</hi> at his coming to the Crown found great difficulties among his Subjects, being bred up without Juſtice, under the long licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Civil Wars, and the lenity of <hi>Clothaire;</hi> whereto he provided wiſely, reducing Juſtice, fortifying it by his Authority, with ſo good a moderation, as no man was offended at his ſeverity, neither durſt any man attempt any thing againſt the Laws, ſeeing both the reign and the rod in the hands of their Lawful Prince: To this good Order he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to love holy things; and the better to confirm this Opinion in the minds of his Subjects, he built and enriched many Temples, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialy that of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> the which hath ſince been the Sepulchre of the <hi>French</hi> Kings.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:95405:24"/>
               <p>This King was much ruled by the forenamed <hi>Arnulph</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Metz,</hi> and by <hi>Pepin</hi> Major of the King's Palace: This <hi>Pepin</hi> was Grandfather to that <hi>Pepin,</hi> who was the firſt King of the ſecond Race of the <hi>French</hi> Kings,<note place="margin">Fabian's Chron. <hi>Part.</hi> 5.</note> and began to deal abſolutely in the Government of the Realm. <hi>Dagobert</hi> and all his Realm were in great honour and tranquillity, till the death of <hi>Arnulph,</hi> after which the King began to change his conditions to the hurt of his whole Realm.</p>
               <p>There were at this time great numbers of Jews in <hi>France,</hi> the which were hurtful to the Realm: <hi>Dagobert</hi> baniſhed them by a perpetual Edict out of the Territories under his obedience. But this Zeal of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was blemiſhed with the ſoul blot of Adultery, which made him infamous both to his Subjects and to Strangers. <hi>Amandus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> reproved him for his fault; but <hi>Dagobert</hi> impatient thereof ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him: Yet by the earneſt perſwaſion of <hi>Pepin,</hi> he yielded to Reaſon, and having diſmiſſed many of his lewd followers, he calleth home <hi>Amandus</hi> again from baniſhment. <hi>Amandus</hi> was a man famous for Holineſs in thoſe dayes.

               <p>To maintain the invocation of Saints, the Papiſts ſay, that at that time the ſoul of <hi>Dagobert</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> was delivered out of the hands of the Devil by <hi>Dionyſius</hi> and <hi>Maurice</hi> Martyrs, and <hi>Martin</hi> the Confeſſor, whom <hi>Dagobert</hi> had Adored.</p>

               <p>In this Council they condemned Sorcery, and the conſulting with Sorcerers, in the firſt, third, fourth and fifth Canons, whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that Sorcery hath been in frequent uſe in <hi>France.</hi>

               <p>They Ordained, that it is not lawful for a Presbyter to ſit in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when any man is condemned to death.</p>
               <p>That it is not lawful for a Clergy-man to cite another of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy before a Secular Judge.</p>

               <p>In this Synod the Canons of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> had great allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.

               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> was endued with ſingular gifts both of body and mind; he had the inſtructions of a virtuous Converſation, and was bred up in Learning and Arms: He was Religious, and reverenced the Churches and Paſtors; he was a great Juſtitiary, a reliever of the poor, and kept his Faith both to friend and foe; he was a lover of Learning and learned men: <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Piſa</hi> inſtructed him in the Greek and Latin Tongues, and <hi>Aimon</hi> in Philoſophy and the Mathematickes: He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in Poetry, but eſpecially in Hiſtory, in which he was well read. The Univerſity of <hi>Paris</hi> built (or enriched) by him, doth witneſs the love and honour he bare to learning. A valiant man, none command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with more obedience, nor performed any thing with greater for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, nor uſed his Victories with more mildneſs and judgement. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did King reign with more Authority, nor was more reverently obeyed than <hi>Charlemagne.</hi>

               <p>All <hi>Italy</hi> being now in peace under the protection of King <hi>Charles,</hi> two Cardinal Prieſts of great account, called <hi>Paſcal</hi> and <hi>Capulus,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired againſt Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> who with their complices apprehended him on a day as he was going in Proceſſion: Some ſay they put out his eyes, and cut out his tongue, committing him priſoner to the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of St. <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> publiſhing abroad, that they did it for the crimes by him committed, and the Errours by him maintained. Some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors affirm, that he was miraculouſly reſtored to his ſight and ſpeech. Hereupon King <hi>Charles</hi> cometh to <hi>Rome,</hi> accompanied with many great Dukes, and other Princes, his Subjects: To him came out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and from many other parts, many Biſhops and Prelates. After eight dayes abode there, he commanded all the Princes and Prelates which then were in the City to be Aſſembled; and the Pope himſelf, and all the reſt being together, there were ſome that accuſed the Pope to the Emperour. Then the Emperour openly asked every mans opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concerning thoſe accuſations; all anſwered, That no man ought to judge the Head of the Church: which the King obſerving, he ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no more queſtions.</p>

               <p>The next day all being Re-aſſembled, the Pope went up into the Pulpit, and taking a Book of the Holy Evangeliſts in his hands, ſaid with a loud voice, That he ſware by God, and thoſe Holy Evangeliſts; That all that which his Adverſaries had laid to his charge, was falſe and untrue; and that he had neither committed, nor thought any ſuch matter as they objected; but that they had of malice and envy ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him; and that he therefore publickly made this Proteſtation, and confirmed it by his Oath, ſeeing that to them all the manner of his Life and Government was well known.</p>
               <p>His Oath was allowed, and himſelf commended, and the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Accuſers, <hi>Paſcal</hi> and <hi>Capulus</hi> to be ſought out, and put to death: But the Pope was content their lives ſhould be ſpared, ſo as they might be committed to priſon, and thence be condemned to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual exile.</p>
               <p>Eight dayes after, the Pope having conſidered, firſt, how much the Greek Emperours envied his Greatneſs, together with the ſmall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction they bare to the worſhipping of Images, and other points, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were oppoſite to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and then how requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite it was to have an Emperour which might maintain the Provinces of <hi>Italy</hi> in peace, which were often diſturbed; but chiefly to ſhew himſelf grateful for the benefits, which he and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had received from him and the Houſe of <hi>France:</hi> But above all, for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting his Proteſtation in his own defence, for a proof of his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, he reſolved to make <hi>Charles</hi> the Great Emperour, and to Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate the Head of the Empire into the Weſt. And having ruminated hereupon, againſt the day of the Nativity of Chriſt, he commanded all the Prieſts, Cardinals, and all the other Prelates to come to a Maſs, whither <hi>Charles</hi> was alſo invited, and came; together with all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes; and ſo about the midſt of the Maſs, the Pope then ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, he turned about from the Altar to the People, and with a loud voice ſaid, That he did there Elect, Create and publiſh <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, the moſt Mighty and Victorious King of <hi>Italy,</hi> of the <hi>Germans,</hi> and of the <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> Emperour and ever <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> Which being done, he ſet the Imperial Crown upon his head, and all thoſe which were preſent conſented thereunto, with acclamations and applauſes, ſaying, <hi>To the moſt Godly, ever</hi> Auguſtus, <hi>Great and moſt Victorious Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi> Charles, <hi>God grant long life and victory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This acclamation being ended, the Pope anointed him, and then and there alſo anointed and entituled his Son <hi>Pepin</hi> (with the good liking and conſent of his Father) King of <hi>Italy.</hi> Which Coronations were performed with great Feaſtings and Solemnity, upon Chriſtmaſs day, <hi>Anno</hi> 800.</p>

                  <hi>Charles</hi> at the requeſt of Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> 1. Baniſhed the <hi>Ambroſian</hi> Service out of his Kingdom, and againſt the will of the <hi>French</hi> Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, by force eſtabliſhed the <hi>Gregorian</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Office. By this change the Latin Tongue in the Publick Service was fully eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>Here I ſhall make mention of one notable paſſage written in the Life of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, namely when he made war againſt the <hi>Saracens</hi> of <hi>Spain. Agoiland</hi> one of the <hi>Saracen</hi> Kings made ſhew of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> and open hatred of the other <hi>Saracen</hi> Kings, with whom notwithſtanding he had a moſt ſtrict correſpondence; to betray <hi>Charles, Agoiland</hi> ſeemed to encline to peace: After many Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers ſent on either part, they reſolve to parley: So upon <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magne</hi>'s Faith, <hi>Agoiland</hi> cometh to the Camp of the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> told the Pagan he ſhould have his Friendſhip, if he would be baptized, and become a Chriſtian: <hi>Agoiland</hi> anſwered, That he was not yet ſo Abject, nor his Forces ſo weak as to refuſe the battel: But becauſe it would be an infinite loſs to hazzard ſo many men, he deſired to make tryal of the Right by ſome Troops; and he that van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed ſhould have the Right, and True Religion on his ſide, prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting to yield to that Religion which ſhould appear to be the beſt by that Tryal. The condition was accepted by <hi>Charlemagne:</hi> The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate being made, the Chriſtian Troop vanquiſhed the <hi>Saracen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>Agoiland</hi> proteſteth openly to be a Chriſtian,<note place="margin">De Serres Hiſt. in vit. <hi>Caroli magni.</hi>
                  </note> but in heart he meant otherwiſe, and takes this occaſion to break the Treaty. One day he finds <hi>Charlemagne</hi> at Table, well acccompanied with his Chief Followers, (for then it was the cuſtom of the <hi>French</hi> Kings not to eat alone) and ſeeth twelve poor men ill-apparelled, ſitting by upon the ground near to the Table of the Noblemen: He demanded what thoſe poor miſerable Creatures were that did feed apart: One anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, They were the Meſſengers and Servants of God: He then ſaid, Their God was of ſmall account, ſeeing his Meſſengers and Servants were ſo miſerable and contemptible, and thereupon retired himſelf; having by this Treaty qualified the Force of <hi>Charles,</hi> viewed his Train, and made ſhew of his Courage, even without an Ambaſſadour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> Reſolved to avenge this affront of the <hi>Saracen,</hi> He raiſeth
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95405:36"/> an Army of an hundred and thirty thouſand men, He returneth into <hi>Spain,</hi> at the firſt encounter he defeated <hi>Agoiland</hi>'s Army near to <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelona,</hi> and for a ſeal of his Victory carrieth away the Head of <hi>Agoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ſlain by the hand of <hi>Arnold</hi> of <hi>Belange,</hi> a Noble and Valiant Knight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> wrote divers Books: He began a Grammar of the <hi>German</hi> Language, but ended it not. He changed the names of the Winds and Months from the Heatheniſh manner. In the Epiſtle to <hi>Alcuinus</hi> before his Books <hi>De Divinis Officiis,</hi> he ſaith, when Chriſt was at ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with his Diſciples, he brake the bread, and gave the cup to them in figure of his body and blood, and left a great Sacrament, which is profitable unto us.</p>

                  <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour made many Laws and Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which <hi>Angiſus,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Lobien,</hi> and then Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> gathered together, with the Conſtitutions of his Son <hi>Lewis,</hi> and divided them into ſeven Books. <hi>Sinderus</hi> teſtifieth, that they were in the Abby of St. <hi>Gallus,</hi> and were not long ſince printed at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi>

                  <hi>Alcuinus</hi> ſaith thus of him, <hi>Charles</hi> was a King in Power, a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick in Faith, an High-Prieſt in Teaching, a Judge in Equity, a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher in Liberal Studies, famous in Manners, and excellent in all Honeſty. He was never ſerved at Table with more than four diſhes at once; his Recreations were hunting, and reading of Hiſtories. He died in <hi>February,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pedro Mexia Hiſt.</note> 
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 814, and was interred at <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> where he was born, and his Memory honoured with a goodly Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph. The greatneſs of his Monarchy is admirable, for he quietly
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95405:36"/> enjoyed all <hi>France, Germany,</hi> and the greateſt part of <hi>Hungary,</hi> all <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and a part of <hi>Spain.</hi> He left his Son <hi>Lewes</hi> ſole Heir of his great Kingdoms, who was the weakeſt of all his Sons.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Monarchy being come to the height of it's Greatneſs, not long after the death of <hi>Charlemagne</hi> it began to decline. The fooliſh lenity of <hi>Lewes</hi> was the beginning, the which was continued by the diſordered confuſions of his Succeſſors, who (in ſpite one to another) haſtened the ruine of their Houſe, making way thereunto by their Vices and Misfortunes. <hi>Lewes</hi> (more fit to be a Monk than a King) was ſo given to Devotion, and of ſo ſoft a ſpirit, that he made his Authority contemptible both within and without the Realm: This made divers Nations ſubject to the Crown, to fall from their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bernard</hi> King of <hi>Italy,</hi> an ambitious young man, was perſwaded by the Biſhops of <hi>Orleans</hi> and <hi>Milan,</hi> to ſeize upon the Realm of <hi>France.</hi> But being in field to go into <hi>France</hi> againſt his Unckle, with an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary favour of the <hi>French</hi> to be proclaimed King, both he and all his Counſellours were taken by <hi>Lewes</hi> his Subjects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lewes</hi> having both his Nephew and Counſellors in his Power, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoils him of all his Realm of <hi>Italy,</hi> confines him to perpetual priſon, and puts out his eyes: the like he doth to all the Biſhops and Noble Men he could get, and after a few dayes cauſeth them to be beheaded. This act from <hi>Lewes,</hi> and committed againſt ſuch perſons, began to breed a general diſlike, the which was aggravated by a domeſtical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention.</p>
               <p>After the death of <hi>Bernard, Lewes</hi> gave <hi>Italy</hi> to his eldeſt Son <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharius,</hi> and aſſociated him in the Empire. To his Son <hi>Pepin</hi> he gave <hi>Aquitain,</hi> to <hi>Lewes Bavaria,</hi> and would have them all bear the name of Kings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lewes</hi> had a Son by <hi>Judith</hi> his ſecond Wife, an ambitious Woman, called <hi>Charles.</hi> This Woman play'd the Empreſs and Queen over all, which cauſed <hi>Lewes</hi> to be hated and contemned. His Sons, <hi>Lotharius, Pepin</hi> and <hi>Lewes,</hi> by the Advice of the Biſhops (who were incenſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Emperour by reaſon of the death of thoſe Church-men) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to ſeize upon their Father, Mother, and younger Brother, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs them of all Authority, and then to govern the States after their own wills, wherein they muſt uſe force, and a publick conſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lotharius</hi> lieves a great Army, and calleth a National Council of the <hi>French</hi> Church at <hi>Lions,</hi> ſuppoſing ſooner to ſuppreſs <hi>Lewes</hi> by this means than by a Parliament. <hi>Lewes</hi> appeareth, and yieldeth to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Prelates, which was to retire himſelf into a Monaſtery, there to attend his Devotion, and to reſign the Empire and the Realm to his Children. So <hi>Lewes</hi> was conveyed to <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> to the Monaſtery of St. <hi>Medard;</hi> his Wife and her Son <hi>Charles</hi> were committed to other
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95405:37"/> places, and the whole Government committed to <hi>Lotharius</hi> and his Brethren. And the greateſt of the Church-men were guilty of this Out-rage, ſeeking to maintain their Decrees. <hi>Lewes</hi> continued in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon five years, <hi>viz.</hi> from the year 829, unto the year 834.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Lotharius</hi> being forced to yield to his Father, goes to field, takes him priſoner again, and leads him back to the Convent at <hi>Soiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> where he ſtayed not long, for the <hi>French</hi> did bandy openly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Lotharius,</hi> and his Brethren abandoned him, ſo as he was forced to yield unto his Father, and to crave pardon. Then <hi>Lewes</hi> gives por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to his Children, to <hi>Lotharius</hi> he leaves the Realm of <hi>Auſtraſia,</hi> from the River of <hi>Mens</hi> unto <hi>Hungary,</hi> with the Title of Emperour; unto <hi>Lewes Bavaria,</hi> and unto <hi>Chrarles France: Pepin</hi> enjoyed <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> without contradiction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lewes</hi> not content with <hi>Bavaria,</hi> levies an Army, and paſſeth the <hi>Rhine.</hi> The miſerable Father prepares an Army to go againſt him, but he falls ſick and dieth, <hi>Anno</hi> 840.</p>
               <p>There was a Council held at <hi>Paris</hi> by the Command of <hi>Lewes,</hi> and his Son <hi>Lotharius, Anno</hi> 829, and three others at the ſame time in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, as is collected from the Preface. It was Ordained, that Synods ſhould then be Aſſembled in four ſeveral places of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
               <p>In his Reign, in <hi>France</hi> was uſed of Prieſts and Church-men preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſhining Veſtures, and golden and rich ſtaring Girdles, with Rings and other Ornaments of Gold:<note place="margin">Fabian's Chron.</note> Wherefore the ſaid <hi>Lewes</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured of the Pope a correction for all ſuch as uſed ſuch ſtrange apparel, cauſing them to wear brown and ſad colours.</p>
               <p>After the death of the Emperour <hi>Lewes, Lotharius</hi> his eldeſt Son, and Emperour by his Fathers Teſtament, would force his Brethren to a new diviſion. He quarrelleth with <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Lewes</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria;</hi> but the two Brethren unite together, and joyn their Forces to oppoſe <hi>Lotharius.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> called the Bald, began his Reign, <hi>Anno</hi> 841.<note place="margin">King <hi>Charles</hi> was preſent at the Council holden at <hi>Piſtis</hi> upon <hi>Sein, Anno</hi> 963.

               <p>This King <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald, relying on the Popes help, favoured the Pope with all his Power, and brought the <hi>French</hi> Clergy to the ſubjection of the <hi>Roman</hi> See, as much as he could: Then began the Popes Legates to come to the Councils of <hi>France,</hi> and there to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide.

               <p>The firſt Pope that made tryal of his Excommunications againſt them was Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the firſt, who threatned <hi>Lothary</hi> to Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate him, unleſs he recalled <hi>Tietberga</hi> his Wife, whom he had put away, to take <hi>Waldrada</hi> whom he loved, which alſo this Pope did Excommunicate: Whereupon there was great murmuring of the Prelates and People of <hi>France</hi> againſt the Pope, being diſpleaſed both at the Pope's Uſurpations, and the puſillanimity of their Kings.

               <p>It was in this ninth Age, that the Decretals were forged by <hi>Riculphus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> as is ſuppoſed, who publiſhed them under a falſe Title. And at that time, and a long time after the Arch-Biſhops of <hi>Mentz</hi> were the firſt promoters of Papal Authority in <hi>Germany.</hi> And nothing hath helped more to the eſtabliſhment of the Papal Empire, than theſe Epiſtles, which have for a long time been held for Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in the Weſt; by them the Father of lies hath wrought very pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully.</p>
               <p>Theſe Decretals were forged under the Reign of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> and of his Son <hi>Lewes</hi> the Gentle, being unknown before, and never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in all Antiquity, bearing on the front the name of <hi>Iſidorus Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator;</hi> and in ſome Copies <hi>Iſidorus Mercator,</hi> a man unknown, and a name forged at will.</p>
               <p>That Collection of Decretals began to go about in <hi>France</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald. The firſt that uſed them, was <hi>Hinckmar</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Laon</hi> upon this occaſion: <hi>Hinckmar</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Rhemes</hi> had promoted to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Laon</hi> another <hi>Hinckmar</hi> his Nephew, who having excommunicated his Clergy, and hindered the Divine Service, and the Baptiſm of Children in his own Biſhoprick, and committed divers crimes and exceſſes, was cited to appear before his Unckle, who was his Metropolitan: But he would not obey nor appear. Upon that <hi>Hinckmar</hi> of <hi>Rhemes</hi> diſanulled all the Acts of <hi>Hinckmar</hi> of <hi>Laon,</hi> and would ſynodically proceed againſt him.</p>
               <p>Hereupon <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald Convocated a Council in <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciniacum,</hi> conſiſting of ten Biſhops; the Biſhops of <hi>Lions, Vaſon</hi> and <hi>Triers</hi> were Chief Preſidents in the Council. <hi>Hinckmarus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rhemes</hi> propoſed unto the Council fifty Canons, which he deſired to be read in the Synod. <hi>Hinckmar</hi> of <hi>Laon</hi> to defend himſelf brought forth the Collection of the Decretals, of the ancient Popes made by <hi>Iſidorus,</hi> where by the Popes Decrees ſuch cauſes are reſerved to the Apoſtolick See.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hinckmar</hi> of <hi>Rhemes</hi> being not learned enough to know the forgery of the Author of theſe Decretals, and not daring to reject them open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, brought divers things to invalid their Authority. He ſaid, that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95405:38"/> 
                  <hi>Hinckmar</hi> of <hi>Laon</hi> was miſtaken, if he thought that he was the only man that had thoſe Epiſtles; that the Countrey was full of them, and that <hi>Riculfus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Mentz</hi> had publiſhed the Book of Epiſtles col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by <hi>Iſidorus,</hi> which was brought to him out of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hinckmar</hi> alſo (to defend himſelf againſt thoſe Epiſtles) ſaid, that they had been good in their time, but that the Fathers Aſſembled in Council had altered thoſe things, and made Canons of greater Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which are to remain perpetually; and that thoſe Decretals were never put in among the Canons of the Church. That ſtrife between the two <hi>Hinckmars</hi> happened <hi>Anno</hi> 870.</p>
               <p>The Synod forenamed, accuſed <hi>Hinckmar</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Laon</hi> of petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy, and compelled him to ſubſcribe obedience to King <hi>Charles,</hi> and to his Metropolitan: He was alſo deprived of his Office, and both his eyes were thruſt out. But Pope <hi>John</hi> IX,<note place="margin">Hiſt. Magdeb. <hi>Cent.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 9.</note> under the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Groſs, reſtored him to his Office again, being the more affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, becauſe he had appealed from his own Biſhop, and from a Decree of a Synod in his own Countrey to be judged by the Chair of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> beſtirred himſelf with violence againſt <hi>Hinckmar</hi> of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> complaining that he deſpiſed the Decretals collected by <hi>Iſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus. Hinckmar</hi> reſiſted him ſtifly, neither did he ever ſuffer the cauſes which he had judged to be reviſed at <hi>Rome,</hi> nor any man that had been depoſed by the Synods of <hi>France,</hi> to be reſtored by the Pope. And all his life time he maintained with great conſtancy ſo much liberty as remained to the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, which liberty ſuffered by his death a great diminution. The Popes durſt not touch him becauſe he was the King's Unckle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baronius</hi> writing of this <hi>Hinckmar</hi> of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> notably abuſeth him, for he ſaith, That upon the teſtimony of <hi>Fredoard, Hinckmar</hi> had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> IV, by the mediation of the Emperour <hi>Lothary,</hi> a <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium,</hi> or Archiepiſcopal Cloak, with a privilege to uſe it every day. But <hi>Hinckmar</hi> himſelf in the Book of the fifty five Chapters, ſaith the contrary, ſpeaking in this manner, <hi>Leo</hi> IV, and <hi>Benedictus</hi> did confer upon me ſome privileges, which I did not ask for. For the privileges which are conferred upon every Metropolitan by the ſacred Canons, are ſufficient for me. It was a generous part of <hi>Hinckmar,</hi> to declare that he had no need of the Pope's privileges, and that he held his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from the Canons, not from the <hi>Roman</hi> Prelate.</p>

               <p>The Pope was ſcarce gone but <hi>Lewes</hi> dieth, having reigned only two years. He had no lawful Children, but two Baſtards: he left his Wife with Child. The Queen was afterward delivered of a Son, which was ſaluted King, and called <hi>Charles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During the minority of <hi>Charles, Lewes</hi> and <hi>Carloman</hi> Brothers, the two Baſtards of <hi>Lewes</hi> the <hi>Stutterer,</hi> are choſen by the States to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Realm of <hi>France. Lewes</hi> was defeated by the <hi>Normans,</hi> and

Another <hi>Lewes</hi> ſucceedeth to theſe two Brethren, but he quickly dyed. Then the States called <hi>Charles the Groſs,</hi> King of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> to this high Dignity. He began his reign, <hi>Anno</hi> 885, and reigned nine years. His entrance was goodly, but his end Tragical. He was crowned King with promiſe to reſtore the Crown to the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Heir, and to govern according to the will of the States.

               <p>They cauſed <hi>Charles</hi> to quit the Crown, diſcharging him with the name of ſimple or fooliſh, and declaring him incapable of ſo great a charge. <hi>Robert</hi> arms boldly againſt <hi>Charles,</hi> to diſpoſſeſs him of his Eſtate. <hi>Charles</hi> flees to <hi>Henry</hi> the third Emperour, and laboureth to calm this ſtorm.</p>
               <p>At the approach of their Armies, <hi>Robert</hi> (to have ſome Title to make a War) cauſeth himſelf to be Crowned King at <hi>Rhemes,</hi> by <hi>Herve</hi> the Arch-Biſhop, who died three days after this unlawful Coronation.</p>
               <p>As the Armies approach near <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> ſtriving (in the view of <hi>Paris</hi>) they joyn, the combate is cruel, but <hi>Robert</hi> fighting in the Front is ſlain, leaving for that time the victory to King <hi>Charles,</hi> who ſeeks a Treaty of Peace, out of an unſeaſonable fear. <hi>Hebert,</hi> Earl of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandois,</hi> Son-in-law to <hi>Robert,</hi> beſeecheth <hi>Charles</hi> to come to St. <hi>Quintins</hi> to confer together. <hi>Charles</hi> cometh thither without Hoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. <hi>Hebert</hi> there takes him Priſoner, and conveys him to <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> where he had aſſembled the chief of the Realm, choſen after his own humour, where he makes him to reſign the Crown to <hi>Raoul</hi> his God-ſon, the firſt Prince of the Blood by his Mother <hi>Hermingrade,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Lewes,</hi> and Wife of <hi>Boſon</hi> King of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> So this poor Prince is led from Priſon to Priſon for five years and dyeth of a languiſhing melancholy.</p>
               <p>He had by his Wife <hi>Ogin a</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Edward</hi> King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> a Son named <hi>Lewes.</hi> She takes her Son <hi>Lewes,</hi> and flees into <hi>England,</hi> to her Brother <hi>Athelſtan</hi> who then Reigned.</p>
               <p>But the Reign of <hi>Raoul</hi> was unfortunate, who Reigned thirteen years during <hi>Charles</hi> his impriſonment, and after his Death.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Raoul</hi> after many broils dyeth at <hi>Compiegne, Anno</hi> 936. Now are great confuſions in <hi>France,</hi> there is nothing ſacred; all is violated for Rule, all reſpect is laid aſide, every one plays the King within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for one King there are many; and where there are many Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, there are none at all. In this confuſion there were many Kings, Dukes and Earls, although theſe Titles were but temporary, having no other Title but the Sword. There was no Governour of any Province throughout the Realm, which held not proper to himſelf and his Heirs, thoſe things which were given to them but as Offices. From hence ſprang ſo many Dukedoms, Earldoms, Baronies, and Seignories, which for the moſt part are returned to their beginnings. <hi>Italy</hi> (given to an Infant of <hi>France</hi>) was now poſſeſſed by divers Princes. <hi>Germany</hi> (withdrawn from the Crown) was banded into divers factions, ſo as the Empire of the Weſt, confirmed in the perſon of <hi>Charlemaigne,</hi> continued ſcarce one hundred years in his Race: for <hi>Lewes</hi> the Son of <hi>Arnulph,</hi> was the laſt Emperour of this Blood.

For the Emperours of the Eaſt did run headlong to their ruine, who were men either of no valour, or altogether wicked, attending the laſt blow by the hand of the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> whoſe power they ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by their vitious lives, until they had lodged them upon their own heads.</p>
               <p>In theſe confuſions of State the power of the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed daily, by the ruines of the Empire. The deſign of the Popes was to erect a Monarchy in the Church, by Power and Authority, Seignories, civil Diſſentions, Arms, Revenues, and Treaſon: And ſoon after they grew to that greatneſs, as they ſought to preſcribe Laws to Emperours and Kings, who refuſing it, and diſputing this primacy, many diſſentions aroſe, and were diſperſed among the people.</p>
               <p>After the Death of <hi>Raoul, Athelſtan</hi> King of <hi>England</hi> (having drawn unto him <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi>) ſends an honourable Ambaſſage to the States of <hi>France,</hi> entreating them to reſtore his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew <hi>Lewes,</hi> to his lawful and Hereditary Dignity. The <hi>French</hi> conſent to it: So <hi>Lewes,</hi> the Son of <hi>Charles,</hi> is called home by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of <hi>France,</hi> being accompanied with a great Troop of <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> and <hi>Normans.</hi>

               <p>About this time, <hi>Ambroſe Ansbert,</hi> a <hi>French-man,</hi> wrote Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries on the <hi>Pſalms</hi> and <hi>Canticles,</hi> and part of the <hi>Revelation.</hi>

               <p>In this tenth Century there was little ſtudy of liberal Sciences, the Schools were few, and empty of Languages. The Popiſh Prieſts and Clergy (having forſaken their old Diſcipline) were given to filthy lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre, nor were they reſpected by their flocks; only Monks were noted to have ſome Eloquence. And ſuch was the corruption of the times, that none durſt ſcarce ſpeak of the Corruptions, Idolatries, Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and wickedneſſes of that Age, which at that time were ſo luxuriant.

                  <hi>Lewes</hi> V. reigned one year only, and dyed without Heir, leaving his place void in troubles of State, and confuſion of times horribly corrupted, unto the Houſe of <hi>Hugh le grand,</hi> Earl of <hi>Paris,</hi> God had prepared the means, both for the Father to lay the foundation, and for his Son <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> (appointed for the Regal Dignity) to finiſh this goodly building.</p>
               <p>Now cometh in the third race of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> called <hi>Capets,</hi> of the name of <hi>Hugh Capet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> was firſt Prince of the Blood-royal, he was Son to <hi>Lewes</hi> IV.

But <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> was choſen King by the <hi>French</hi> aſſembled in Parliament, and <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was rejected from the Crown.</p>
               <p>This change happened in <hi>July, Anno</hi> 987. This new King was ſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Capet,</hi> or <hi>Capitoſus,</hi> either for that he had a great Head, or that (being young) he was accuſtomed to catch at his Companions caps, as a preſage of that he ſhould do unto Kings. <hi>Otho</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> two other Sons of <hi>Hugh le grand,</hi> were Dukes of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> one after another; his other Sons were advanced to Eccleſiaſtical Dignities, the one Arch-Biſhop
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95405:42"/> of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> the other of <hi>Rovan,</hi> and another dyed young.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles of Lorrain</hi> gathered an Army, and entring <hi>France</hi> came to the City of <hi>Laon,</hi> within which City he by the Treaſon of <hi>Anſelm</hi> the Biſhop of that City, was taken and delivered with his Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren into the hands of his Enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hugh</hi> being crowned King, cauſeth his Son <hi>Robert</hi> to be crowned King at <hi>Rhemes, Anno</hi> 990. three years after his Father's election. <hi>Hugh</hi> decreeth, that the elder Son ſhould reign alone among his Brethren: and ſuppreſſeth the Majors of the Palace.</p>
               <p>He likewiſe decreed, that hereafter Baſtards ſhould not be only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected from the Crown, but alſo from the ſir-name of <hi>France,</hi> the which before was allowed them.

               <p>
                  <hi>Arnulph,</hi> Baſtard to <hi>Lothair,</hi> was the only Man which had favoured <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> againſt <hi>Hugh Capet.</hi> This Man was both perverſe and diſloyal, having deceived both <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and <hi>Hugh Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,</hi> who had given him the Arch-biſhoprick of <hi>Rovan,</hi> in recompence of the ſervice he promiſed him againſt <hi>Charles,</hi> to whom (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding) contrary to his Faith, he gave means to ſeize upon the Cities of <hi>Rhemes, Laon</hi> and <hi>Soiſſons. Hugh</hi> therefore reſolves to ſuppreſs <hi>Arnulph:</hi> but reſpecting his quality, he aſſembled a National Council of the <hi>French</hi> Church in the City of <hi>Rhemes.</hi> This Aſſembly depoſed <hi>Arnulph,</hi> as guilty of Treachery, and a troubler of the publick quiet; and they ſubſtitute <hi>Gilbert</hi> in his place, who had been School-maſter unto <hi>Robert.</hi> Afterwards <hi>Hugh</hi> confines him to <hi>Orleans</hi> with <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> there to end his days in reſt.</p>
               <p>The Prelates of <hi>France</hi> in this Synod, made a Declaration, that the Popes have nothing to do to uſurp the power and authority of Kings. <hi>Arnalt,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Orleans,</hi> maintained in that Synod, that the Popes have no power at all over the Biſhops of <hi>France,</hi> ſo as to have any cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of Caſes belonging to them: and he declaimed moſt ſtoutly againſt the avarice and corruption of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <p>This <hi>Robert</hi> builded the Caſtle of <hi>Mountfort:</hi> He founded alſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Monaſteries and Temples, at <hi>Orleans</hi> the Temple of St. <hi>Avian,</hi> at <hi>Stamps</hi> a Church dedicated to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and many other in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places of his Realm.

               <p>At this time flouriſhed <hi>Fulbert,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chartres,</hi> a very learned Man: Sundry Sermons and Treatiſes that are amongſt the works of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> are ſaid to be his.

               <p>King <hi>Robert</hi> dyed <hi>Anno</hi> 1031. His Son <hi>Henry</hi> ſucceeded him; and reigned 33 years. In his time the Realm of <hi>Burgundy</hi> had an end in the poſterity of <hi>Boſon,</hi> and the Emperours of <hi>Germany</hi> challenged the right and title of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> had maintained the Hereditary love of his Father with King <hi>Henry,</hi> greatly relying upon his friendſhip. Having reſolved upon a long and dangerous Voyage to the Holy-land,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:95405:44"/> he intreated him to take the protection of <hi>William</hi> his Baſtard Son, whom he had made his Heir, excluding his lawful Children. <hi>Robert</hi> ſettled his Eſtate before his departure, appointing him good Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and putting the ſtrongeſt holds, and treaſure into their hands. <hi>Robert</hi> dyed in this long Voyage beyond the Seas, at the City of <hi>Bythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia;</hi> having before his departure commanded the Lords of <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> and ſworn them, and <hi>Robert</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Rovan,</hi> to perform their Allegiance unto his Son <hi>William,</hi> and to take him for their Lord and Duke, if he return not again.</p>
               <p>When King <hi>Henry</hi> had ſettled his Land in quietneſs, he then builded the Monaſtery of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> called <hi>Des Champs,</hi> beſides <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſet therein ſecular Prieſts.

               <p>
                  <hi>Berengarius</hi> a <hi>French-man,</hi> Deacon of St. <hi>Maurice</hi> in <hi>Anjou,</hi> was the Diſciple of <hi>Fulbert.</hi> He was the firſt that was accounted an Heretick for denying of Tranſubſtantiation, and troubled for the ſame. In his days it was broached, that the Bread of the Euchariſt was the very body of Chriſt, and the Wine his Blood, ſubſtantially or properly. <hi>Berengarius</hi> on the contrary, taught that the Body of Chriſt is only in the Heavens, and theſe Elements are the Sacraments of his Body and Blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adelman</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Brixia</hi> wrote unto him. In the beginning he ſaluteth him as his holy and beloved Brother, and Con-diſciple under <hi>Fulbert</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chartres.</hi> Then he ſheweth, he heard it reported, that <hi>Berengarius</hi> did teach, that the Body and Blood of Chriſt, which are offered upon the Altar throughout the Earth, are not the very Body and Blood of Chriſt, but only a figure or certain ſimilitude, howbeit indeed <hi>Berengarius</hi> had ſaid nothing ſo. To the intent <hi>Adel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> may bring his Brother from this opinion, he entreateth him not to depart from the Doctrine of their Maſter <hi>Fulbert,</hi> and of the Catholick Church. Then he appealeth to the teſtimony of <hi>Ambroſe, Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Hierome</hi> [who never taught the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation.] He writeth alſo, that the very Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt, was given unto the Apoſtles at the firſt Inſtitution, and are ſtill given unto faithful Communicants. <hi>Adelman</hi> enlarged much on this ſubject.</p>
               <p>What anſwer <hi>Berengarius</hi> did return to him, we find not. But he wrote an Epiſtle to <hi>Lanfrank</hi> declaring the abuſes of the Sacrament, and commending the Book of <hi>John Scotus</hi> upon that queſtion.<note place="margin">Occolampad. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. l. 3.</note> And he wrote expreſly, that the Body of Chriſt is not in the Sacrament, but as in a ſign, figure or myſtery. He ſpake alſo in his Preachings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:95405:45"/> the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church in the Doctrine of Marriage, and neceſſity of Baptiſm. And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> witneſſeth, that <hi>Berengarius</hi> called the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the malignant Church, the Council of vanity, and the ſeat of <hi>Satan,</hi> and he called the Pope, not <hi>Pontificem, vel Epiſcopum, ſed pompificem, &amp; Pulpificem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It happened, that <hi>Lanfrank</hi> was not at home, and the Convent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the Letter of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> and ſent it with a Clerk of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> unto Pope <hi>Leo</hi> IX. The Pope ſummoned a Synod at <hi>Verceles. Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius</hi> was adviſed not to go himſelf to the Synod, but ſend ſome Clerks in his name to anſwer for him. The two Clerks were clapt in Priſon. <hi>Scotus</hi> was condemned 200 years after his death, and the Doctrine of <hi>Berengarius</hi> was condemned, yet nothing done againſt his Perſon at that time, becauſe many favoured him. <hi>Lanfrank</hi> pleaded for him: but he was commanded by the Pope to anſwer him, under no leſs pain than to be reputed as great an Heretick as he.<note place="margin">Petries. Ch. Hiſt. <hi>Cent.</hi> 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Lanfrank</hi> following the ſway of the World (for afterwards he was made Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> by <hi>Willliam</hi> the Conquerour) performed the charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guitmund,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Averſa,</hi> wrote more bitterly, and leſs truly againſt <hi>Berengarius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs <hi>Berengarius</hi> abode conſtant, and was in great eſteem both with the Nobility and People: And therefore Pope <hi>Victor</hi> the ſecond, gave direction to the Biſhops of <hi>France,</hi> to take order with him. The Pope's Ambaſſadours were preſent at the Council, and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarius</hi> anſwered, that he adhered to no particular opinion of his own, but he followed the common Doctrine of the Univerſal Church, that is, ſaith he, as the Fathers, Primitive Church, and Scriptures have taught. This gentle anſwer mitigated the fury of his Adverſaries: yet he perſiſted in his own opinion; and for this cauſe <hi>Lanfrank</hi> object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt him, that he deluded the Council of <hi>Tours</hi> with general and doubtful words.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Du. Moul. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tr.

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:95405:45"/> at laſt when diſputation could not prevail againſt him, he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to recant, or elſe he muſt expect to be burnt.

               <p>Theſe are the words ſo far as they concern our preſent purpoſe,<note place="margin">Maſſons Annal.

               <p>
                  <hi>John Semeca,</hi> the Gloſſator of the Decrees, expreſly condemneth the words of this Recantation, and ſaith, If thou underſtandeſt not the words of <hi>Berengarius</hi> ſoundly, thou ſhalt fall into a greater Hereſie than he did: for we break not Chriſt<hi>'s</hi> body into pieces, <hi>niſi in ſpeciebus.</hi>

But the Fathers of higher antiquity condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all oral eating as <hi>Capernaitiſm;</hi> neither were the <hi>Capernaites</hi> ſo ſubtle, as to make ſuch diſtinctions: yea ſurely Chriſt would have made his correction according to their errour.

               <p>Here St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> oppoſeth carnal eating unto ſpiritual eating, and he ſaith, that carnally men eat not the fleſh of Chriſt, but the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his fleſh.</p>

He had encountred King <hi>Harold</hi> and overcome his Hoſt, in that place where afterward was buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Abbey of <hi>Battle</hi> in <hi>Suſſex.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The day after the Battle very early in the morning, <hi>Odo</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Baieux</hi> ſung Maſs for thoſe that were departed, being ſlain in the Battle.</p>
               <p>Before this time Prieſts were forbidden to marry, but could not be reſtrained from their liberty.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1074. Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. otherwiſe <hi>Hildebrand</hi> in a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod at <hi>Rome,</hi> condemned all married Prieſts as <hi>Nicolaitans.</hi> He di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected his Bulls (as they called them) to Biſhops, Dukes, and other Powers, declaring every one to be no Prieſt, that had a Wife. His Bull was ſent into <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi> This Decree being proclaimed through all <hi>Italy,</hi> he ſent many Letters unto the <hi>French</hi> Biſhops, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding that they ſhould upon pain of an everlaſting curſe, put away all the Women from the Houſes of Prieſts. But the reſidue of the Clergy ſtoutly withſtood the Pope<hi>'s</hi> decree, and would not agree thereunto.</p>
               <p>Then there aroſe ſuch a Schiſm in the Church, that the people would not ſend their Prieſts unto the Biſhops, but did elect them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, and put them in Office without the knowledge of the Biſhops. And <hi>Nauclerus</hi> ſaith, that both Prieſts and people did
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95405:47"/> oppoſe the Pope<hi>'s</hi> decree, and that not only in <hi>Germany,</hi> but in <hi>France</hi> alſo. Yea <hi>Gebuiler,</hi> a late Papiſt, teſtifieth, that in thoſe times 24 Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> with their Clergy, did conſtantly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the liberty of Prieſts marriage. If other Nations had followed the like concord and conſtancy of theſe <hi>German</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Miniſters, the deviliſh decree of this <hi>Hildebrand</hi> had been avoided.</p>
               <p>About this time at <hi>Nantes,</hi> a Letter was preſented unto a Clerk, as directed from Hell; in it Satan and all that fry, gave thanks unto all the Popiſh Clergy,<note place="margin">Math.

               <p>After the death of <hi>Hildebrand, Victor</hi> the third, Abbot of <hi>Caſſa,</hi> was made Pope, not by the Election of the <hi>Romans</hi> or Cardinals, but was thruſt in by the aid of his Harlot <hi>Mathilda,</hi> and the <hi>Normans</hi> that were of his faction.</p>
               <p>He being eſtabliſhed, began to defend <hi>Gregorie</hi>'s pranks, againſt the Emperour and others. But the haſtineſs of his death, ſhortned his malice.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Victor</hi> were dead, the Biſhops of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> conſidering the calamities of the Church, by that unhappy ſchiſm,<note place="margin">Avent.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> made a long Oration in the Aſſembly. The Papal party had choſen <hi>Gebhard</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Salisburgh,</hi> to ſpeak in their name, but when he heard the Oration of <hi>Conrade,</hi> he would not open his mouth to ſpeak on the contrary.</p>
               <p>At length a Synod was convocated at <hi>Mentz,</hi> whither came the Emperour, the Electors, and many Dukes, <hi>Peter</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Portua.</hi> and Legate of <hi>Clemens,</hi> and many Biſhops of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> There the faction of <hi>Hildebrand</hi> by common ſuffrage was condemned, as contrary unto Chriſtian piety, and a decree was publiſhed, that all Chriſtians ſhould ſhun the company of thoſe accurſed perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hildebert</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Tours,</hi> lived under <hi>Philip</hi> the firſt King of <hi>France.</hi> At that time the Kings of <hi>France</hi> furniſhed the Churches with Paſtors after the death of the Incumbent.

               </p>
               <p>Whence we collect two things. 1.

               <p>The ſame <hi>Ivo</hi> complains of the Pope's Legate, becauſe he had choſen the City of <hi>Bloyes,</hi> there to decide the cauſe of the Clergy of <hi>Chartres,</hi> who could not repair thither with ſafety by reaſon of the populouſneſs of that City.</p>
               <p>The ſame Biſhop having a controverſie with ſome of his Clergy, depending before the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Sens,</hi> his Metropolitan, intreats him to appoint a place for Judgement, whither they might go and come in ſafety.</p>
               <p>The Legate fore-mentioned, having appointed a Council, conſiſting of <hi>French</hi> Biſhops to meet at <hi>Sens,</hi> for the abſolution of King <hi>Philip</hi> the firſt, from the Excommunication which was darted out againſt him by the Pope, by reaſon of his unlawful marriage, he gives him notice that he might have done better, to have proceeded to that abſolution in another place than <hi>Sens,</hi>

               <p>It happened, that there came a <hi>French</hi> Pilgrim to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> called <hi>Peter</hi> an Hermit,<note place="margin">Tho. Fuller.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95405:48"/> Chriſtians under the Turks, what hope of amendment, and how the matter might be ſecretly contrived, that the Princes in <hi>Europe</hi> might aſſiſt and relieve them. <hi>Peter</hi> moved with the Patriarch<hi>'s</hi> perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the equity and honourableneſs of the cauſe, and chiefly with a Viſion (as they ſay) from Heaven, took the whole buſineſs upon him, and travelled to <hi>Rome,</hi> to conſult with Pope <hi>

               <p>Some think, that the Pope firſt ſecretly employed this Hermit to be his Factor, and to go to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to ſet on foot ſo beneficial a Trade for the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> becauſe the Pope alone was the gainer by this great adventure, and all other Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> came off loſers.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> had called the Council of <hi>Clermont</hi> in <hi>France</hi> foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, where met many Princes and Prelates to whom he made a long oration: which was to this effect. Firſt, he bemoaned the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of the Chriſtians in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the vaſtation of thoſe holy places. Next,<note place="margin">Tyrius li. 1. c. 15.</note> he encouraged the Princes in the Council to take Arms againſt thoſe Infidels; and to break their bonds in ſunder, and to caſt their cords far from them (as it is written) <hi>to caſt out the Handmaid and her Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Otherwiſe, if they would not help to quench their neighbours hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they muſt expect the ſpeedy burning of their own, and that theſe barbarous Nations would quickly over-run all <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to ſet an edge to their courage, he promiſed to all that went this Voyage, a full remiſſion of their ſins, and pennances here, and the enjoying Heaven hereafter. Laſtly, he thus concluded, Gird your Swords to your Thighs, O ye men of might: It is our parts to pray, yours to fight: ours with <hi>Moſes</hi> to hold up unwearied hands to God, yours to ſtretch forth the Sword againſt theſe Children of <hi>Amaleck.

               </p>
               <p>This motion was moſt chearfully entertained, ſo that the whole Aſſembly cryed out, <hi>God willeth it:</hi>

               <p>Now the Pope diverted this queſtion out of Princes Heads, by opening an iſſue another way, and gave vent to the activity of their ſpirits in this Martial employment, and in the mean time quietly went away without any corrival. concluding the controverſie for his own profit.</p>
               <p>Moreover, he got a Maſs of Money by it. He had the office to bear the bag, and what was put into it, as contributed to this action from pious people, and expended but ſome few drops of the ſhowers he received.</p>

               <p>He ſate five years, and ten months. <hi>Honorius</hi> the ſecond ſucceeded him. In the time of this <hi>Honorius, Arnulph</hi> a ſingular preacher of Chriſtian Religion flouriſhed. <hi>Hugo, Platina</hi> and <hi>Sabellicus</hi> ſay, he was Biſhop of <hi>Lions</hi> in <hi>France. Trithemius</hi> ſaith he was a Prieſt, whoſe Hiſtory I will briefly ſet down. <hi>Arnulph,</hi> was a devout, and zealous Man, a worthy preacher; Coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> he rebuked in his preaching the diſſoluteneſs, incontinency, avarice, and pride of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Clergy, provoking all to follow Chriſt and his Apoſtles, rather in their poverty and pureneſs of Life: by reaſon whereof this man was well accepted and liked of the Nobility of <hi>Rome,</hi> for a true Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple of Chriſt: but of the Cardinals and Clergy he was no leſs ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, than favoured of the other; inſomuch that privily in the night ſeaſon they took him and deſtroyed him. This his Martyrdom (ſaith he) was revealed unto him before by an Angel, he being in the deſert when he was ſent forth to preach. Whereupon he thus ſpake unto them publickly. I know (ſaith he) ye ſeek my Life, and will deſtroy me privily, becauſe I preach to you the truth, and blame your pride, avarice, incontinency, with your unſatiable greedineſs in getting and heaping up riches, therefore you are diſpleaſed with me.</p>
               <p>I take here Heaven and Earth to witneſs, that I have preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you that which I was commanded of the Lord, but you contemn me and your Creator, who by his only Son hath redeemed you. And no marvel, if you ſeek my death, being a ſinful man preaching to you the truth, whereas if St. <hi>Peter</hi> were here this day, and rebuked your vices, which do ſo multiply above meaſure, you would not ſpare him neither. And as he was ſaying this with a loud voice, he added, for my part I am not afraid to ſuffer death for the truth's ſake, but this I ſay unto you, that God will look upon your iniquities, and be avenged of you. You being full of all impurity, play the blind guides to the people committed to you, leading them the way to Hell. Thus the hatred of the Popiſh Clergy being incenſed againſt him for preaching, they conſpired againſt him and killed him. <hi>Sabellicus</hi> and <hi>Platina</hi> ſay,<note place="margin">Fox Act. &amp; Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num. ad ann. 1131.</note> that they hanged him, and others that they drowned him.

                  <hi>Hildebert</hi> forementioned, Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Tours,</hi> about this time wrote many Epiſtles: in one unto an Earl going in Pilgrimage, he condemneth Pilgrims for viſiting of Monuments. And ſpeaking of

               <p>He had crowned his eldeſt Son <hi>Philip,</hi> who going to take the Air on Horſe-back, an Hog paſſed under the Belly of his Horſe, which being ſcared threw him down, and bruiſed him ſo, that within few days after he dyed.

               <p>After the death of <hi>Arnulph,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Jeruſalem, Guarimond</hi> born in <hi>France</hi> ſucceeded him.</p>
               <p>About this time the two great orders of Templers and Teutonicks
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:95405:51"/> appeared in the World, The former under <hi>Hugh de Paganis,</hi> and <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred</hi> of St. <hi>Omer</hi> their firſt Founders. They agreed in profeſſion with the Hoſpitallers, and performed it alike, vowing poverty, chaſtity and obedience, and to defend Pilgrims coming to the Sepulchre. It is falſly fathered on St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> that he appointed them their rule, who preſcribeth not what they ſhould do, but only deſcribeth what they did.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time began the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Order, conſiſting only of <hi>Dutch-men</hi> well deſcended, living at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in an houſe, which one of that Nation bequeathed to his Country-men that came thither on Pilgrimage.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Baldwin</hi> was afterwards taken priſoner, and <hi>Euſtace Grenier,</hi> choſen Vice-Roy while the King was in durance, ſtoutly defended the Countrey. <hi>Baldwin</hi> a little before his death renounced the World, and took on him a religious habit.

                  <hi>Baldwin</hi> the third ſucceeded his Father. He was well learned, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in Hiſtory, liberal, witty and facetious.

               <p>This St. <hi>Bernard</hi> Abbot of <hi>Clarevaux,</hi> or <hi>Clareval,</hi> was famous in that time. He often complains of the defection of the Church.</p>
               <p>He ſharply rebuked the vitious lives of Biſhops and Abbots. Yea, he did not ſpare the Popes,<note place="margin">Bern. Ep. 42.</note> as appeareth partly by what he wrote
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95405:52"/> unto Pope <hi>Eugenius,</hi> and unto <hi>Innocent</hi> the ſecond. And for his liberty in ſpeaking againſt the errours of his time,<note place="margin">Epiſt. 178. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log. ad Willerm.

               <p>And he ſaith there, that he was like to be killed every day, and was judged as a ſheep for the ſlaughter; yet nevertheleſs he was not afraid to ſpeak of their vices, becauſe (ſaid he) <hi>melius eſt ut ſcandalum oria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, quam veritas relinquatur: It is better that a ſcandal ſhould ariſe, than truth ſhould be relinquiſhed.</hi> Who at the beginning when the order of Monks began (ſaith he) could think that Monks would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo naughty? Oh how unlike are we to thoſe in the days of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony?</hi> did <hi>Macarius</hi> live in ſuch a manner? did <hi>Baſil</hi> teach ſo? did <hi>Anthony</hi> ordain ſo? did the Fathers in <hi>Egypt</hi> carry themſelves ſo? how is the light of the World become darkneſs? how is the ſalt of the Earth become unſavoury? I am a Lyar (ſaith he) if I have not ſeen an Abbot having above ſixty horſes in his train: when ye ſaw them riding, ye might ſay, Theſe were not Fathers of Monaſteries, but Lords of Caſtles; not feeders of Souls, bur Princes of Provinces.</p>
               <p>They have carried after them their Table-Cloths, Cups, Baſons, Candleſticks, and Portmantua's ſtuffed not with ſtraw, but ornaments of Beds, ſcarce will any of them go four miles from his houſe, but he muſt have all things with him, as if he were going into a leaguer, or through a Wilderneſs, where neceſſaries could not be had. O va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of vanities! the Walls of Churches are glorious, and poor folks are in neceſſity.</p>
               <p>Yet may it be ſaid, that <hi>Bernard</hi> was a follower of the Popes. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, yes; he gave them all the Titles that others gave them: but ſee what blows he gave them, as appeareth by what he wrote to <hi>Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> and <hi>Eugenius,</hi> he lays on them the blame of all the wickedneſs in the Church, In rites he was carried with the ſway of the times, but his Doctrine was far different from the Tenets of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> In one of his Epiſtles he writes thus.<note place="margin">Bern. Epiſt. 91. ad Abbates Sueſs Congreg.</note> I would be in that Council, where the Traditions of Men are not obſtinately defended, nor ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiouſly obſerved, but where they ſearch diligently and humbly, what is the good, perfect and acceptable will of God: thither am I carried with all my deſire; and there would I abide devoutly.</p>

                  <note place="margin">In Tract. de prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. &amp; Diſpenſ.</note>And elſewhere he ſaith, many things were deviſed and ordained; not becauſe they might not be otherwiſe, but becauſe it was ſo expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and certainly but for conſerving charity: therefore ſo long as the things do ſerve charity, let them ſtand without change; nor can they be changed without offence, no not by the Rulers.</p>
               <p>But contrarily, if they be contrary unto charity, in the judgement
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:95405:52"/> of ſuch only unto whom it is granted to overſee, is it not clearly moſt juſt, that what things were deviſed for charity, ſhould alſo be omitted, or intermitted for charity, when it is ſo expedient? or (at leaſt) that they be changed to another thing more expedient: as on the other ſide, certainly it were unjuſt, if theſe things that were ordained for charity, be held againſt charity. Let them therefore hold faſt that which is immoveable.</p>
               <p>The ſame <hi>Bernard</hi> informs us,<note place="margin">Bern. de conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. ad Eugeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um li. 3.</note> that then was held a Council at <hi>Rhemes,</hi> wherein the Pope was preſident. And ſaith he, Brethren I tell you of another Synod, where the Lord God will ſit in Judgement, where we muſt all ſtand, and there will God judge all the World. Here (on earth) unrighteouſneſs is ſhut up in a bag; but in that Judgement God will judge righteouſly: and there we muſt all appear whether he be a Pope, or a Cardinal, or an Arch-Biſhop, or a Biſhop, or poor or rich, or learned or unlearned, that every one may receive according to what he hath done in the body, whether good or ill.</p>
               <p>Moreover, he ſaid unto the Council, that the Impoſthume was ſpread through all the body of the Church, from the ſole of the Foot to the Head, the Bride was ſpoiled, and even they that were called the Bridegrooms of the Church, were not the friends of the Bridegroom? And the Council ſo far took with this rebuke, that ſome Acts were made for Reformation, though no reformation followed.</p>
               <p>About that time had been ſtarted that opinion concerning the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary, viz.</hi> of Univerſal freedom from original ſin: which opinion had been in the minds only of ſome private perſons, but yet was not come among the ceremonies of the Church, nor into the minds of the learned.

He confeſſeth, that they had matter enough to commend the bleſſed Virgin; but ſuch ambitious novelty (which is the mother of fondneſs, the ſiſter of ſuperſtition, and daughter of levity) he ſaith, could not pleaſe her.<note place="margin">Recentiſſimus eſt vixitque poſt confirmatam E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopi Romani Tyrannidem.

                  <hi>Voſſius</hi> and others. He hath ſolidly diſputed concerng the chief Heads of Faith, of the Scriptures of the Church, of the miſery of man, of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:95405:53"/> free juſtification, of grace, of new obedience, with the Catholick Church againſt the Tridentine Fables, ſo that nothing can be found more ſolid.</p>
               <p>In the Council of <hi>Rhemes</hi> forementioned (where were aſſembled 434 Prelats) theſe five principal acts were concluded.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That no Man ſhould either buy, or ſell any Biſhoprick, Abbot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,<note place="margin">Fox Act and Monum.</note> Deanry, Arch Deaconſhip, Prieſthood, Prebendſhip, Altar, or any Eccleſiaſtical promotion, or Benefice, Orders, Conſecration, Church-hallowing, Seat or Stall within the Quire, or any Office Eccleſiaſtical, under pain of Excommunication, if he did perſiſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That no Lay-perſon ſhould give Inveſtiture, or any Eccleſiaſtical poſſeſſion, and that no ſpiritual man ſhould receive any ſuch at any Lay-man's hand under pain of deprivation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That no man ſhould invade, take away, or detain the goods or poſſeſſions of the Church, but that they ſhould remain firm and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, under pain of perpetual curſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That no Biſhop or Prieſt ſhould have any Eccleſiaſtical Dignity or benefice to any, by way of inheritance. Adding moreover, that for Baptiſm, Chriſm, Anointing, Burial, no Money ſhould be exacted.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Item,</hi> That all Prieſts, Deacons, and Sub-Deacons, ſhould be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly debarred and ſequeſtred from company of their Wives and Concubines, under pain of excluding from all Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
               <p>The Acts thus determined were ſent ſoon after to <hi>Henry</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, to try (before the breaking up of the Council) whether he would agree to the Canonical Elections, free conſecration, and inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſpiritual perſons; and to other Acts of the ſaid Council. The Emperour maketh anſwer, that he would loſe nothing of that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Cuſtom, which his Progenitors had given him: Yet becauſe of the authority of the general Council, he was content to conſent to the reſidue, ſave only the inveſting of Eccleſiaſtical function to be taken from him, unto that he would never agree. Upon this, at the next return of the Pope to the Council, <hi>Henry</hi> the Emperour was excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1142. Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> came to <hi>Paris,</hi> where that he might uſurp the right of inveſtiture, and deprive the King of it, he gave the Arch-Biſhoprick of <hi>Bourges,</hi> to his Chancellour of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Chancery, named <hi>Peter Aimery</hi> without the conſent of King <hi>Lewes,</hi> a Prince very much given to obedience unto the Papal See. Yet the King was ſo angry at it, that he ſwore upon the Holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, that never ſo long as he lived, <hi>Aimery</hi> ſhould ſet his foot in <hi>Bourges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Pope knowing the King's timerous nature, excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, put his perſon in interdict, and gave order that in <hi>France,</hi> in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:95405:53"/> all places where the King came, divine Service ſhould ceaſe; and all his Court were deprived of the Communion.</p>
               <p>This laſted three whole years till St. <hi>Bernard</hi> came to the King, and perſwaded him to receive the ſaid Arch-Biſhop.</p>
               <p>But becauſe by ſo doing, the King brake his Oath made upon the Holy Relicks, he was enjoyned for ſatisfaction to take a Journey to the Holy Sepulchre in <hi>Syria,</hi> to fight againſt the <hi>Saracens.</hi> In which Journey the King loſt the flower of the <hi>French</hi> Nobility, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned afflicted and full of confuſion, as you ſhall ſee more hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Clugny</hi> was in great account with Pope <hi>Eugenius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bernard</hi> wrote many Epiſtles to him: in one Epiſtle he calleth him a Veſſel of Honour, full of Grace and Truth, and endued with many gifts.</p>
               <p>The loſs of <hi>Edeſſa</hi> (wherein Chriſtianity had flouriſhed ever ſince the Apoſtles times) moved <hi>Conrade</hi> Emperour of the Weſt, and <hi>Lewes</hi> VII. ſir-named the young, King of <hi>France,</hi> to undertake a Voyage to the Holy Land.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> III. beſtirred himſelf in the matter, and made St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſtis ſolicitour to advance the deſign. The Emperour's Army contained two hundred thouſand foot, beſides fifty thouſand Horſe: nor was the Army of King <hi>Lewes</hi> much inferiour in number.<note place="margin">Paul. Aemil. in Lud. VII.</note> In <hi>France</hi> they ſent a Diſtaff and a Spindle to all thoſe that went not with them, as upbraiding their effeminateneſs. But by the way, the <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperour did them all poſſible miſchief, by mingling lime with their meal, by killing of ſtraglers, by holding intelligence with the <hi>Turks</hi> their enemies, by corrupting his Coyn, ſo that the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſold good Wares for bad Money, and bought bad Wares with good Money, by giving them falſe conductors, which trained them into danger, ſo that there was more fear of the guides than of the way.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> followed after the Emperour, and drank of the ſame Cup at the <hi>Grecians</hi> hands, though not ſo deeply, till at laſt, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that thoſe who marched through the Continent, met with an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean of miſery, he thought better to truſt the Wind and the Sea than the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and taking ſhipping, ſafely arrived in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> where he was welcomed by <hi>Reimund</hi> Prince of <hi>Antioch.</hi> Some weeks were ſpent in entertainment, and viſiting holy places, till at laſt,<note place="margin">Tho.

               <p>The Emperour and the <hi>French</hi> King beſiege <hi>Damaſcus:</hi> but ſome of the Chriſtians corrupted with <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Money, perſwaded the King of

The <hi>French</hi> Proverb was verified of this Voyage: <hi>Much bruit, and little fruit.</hi> Many thouſand Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans periſhed in this adventure.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> King coming homeward, was taken priſoner by the Fleet of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperour, and reſcued again by <hi>Gregory,</hi> Admiral to <hi>Roger</hi> King of <hi>Sicily.</hi> When he was arrived in <hi>France,</hi> his Wife was in open Parliament divorſed from him. He gave her back again all the Lands in <hi>France</hi> which he had received with her in portion. Herein he did nobly, but not politickly, to part with the Dukedoms of <hi>Poictou</hi> and <hi>Aquitain,</hi> which he enjoyed in her right: for hereby he diſmembred his own Kingdom, and gave a torch into the hands of <hi>Henry</hi> II. King of <hi>England</hi> (who afterwards married her) to ſet <hi>France</hi> on fire. St. <hi>Bernard</hi> was condemned among the vulgar ſort for the murtherer of thoſe that went this Voyage; and it was an heavy affliction for his aged back,<note place="margin">Bern. de conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. li. 2. ca. 1.</note> to bear the reproach of many people.

                  <hi>Peter de Bruis,</hi> a prieſt at <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> preached in ſundry places againſt the Popes, and the Doctrine of <hi>Rome,</hi> calling the Pope the Prince of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> he called <hi>Babylon,</hi> the mother of Whoredoms and confuſion.

               <p>The Title of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was given to <hi>Philip</hi> his Son and ſucceſſour.

               <p>Now ſprang up the Doctrine and name of them, which were then called <hi>Pauperes de Lugduno,</hi> which of one <hi>Waldus,</hi> a chief Senator in <hi>Lyons,</hi> were named <hi>Waldenſes;</hi> they were alſo called <hi>Leoniſtae, &amp; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabbatati,</hi> about the year of our Lord 1170.</p>
               <p>It happened on a day as divers of the principal men of the City aſſembled together, conſulted upon divers matters, that one of the company fell down and dyed ſuddenly, the reſt of the company look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on. This <hi>Waldus</hi> being terrified at the ſight of it, was converted, and preſently reformed his Life. He miniſtred of his Goods large Alms to the Poor, he purchaſed a Bible, ſtudied the Scriptures, inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, and his Family with the true knowledge of God's word. He admoniſhed all that reſorted to him to repentance and amendment of Life. He gave out to them that were ready to learn certain rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Scripture, which himſelf had tranſlated into the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, for he was both Wealthy and Learned.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prelates threatned to excommunicate him: but he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting their threatnings, ſaid, <hi>God muſt be obeyed rather than Man.</hi> At length they drave both <hi>Waldus,</hi> and all his adherents out of the City. The Articles of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> I find in order and number to be theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That only the Holy Scripture is to be believed, in matters per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to Salvation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. All things to be contained in Holy Scripture neceſſary to Salvation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That there is one only Mediator; that other Saints are in no wiſe to be made Mediators, or to be invocated.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They rejected purgatory, aſſerting that all men, either by Chriſt are juſtified to Life, or without Chriſt be condemned, and beſides theſe two, neither any third or fourth place to be.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That all Maſſes, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as be ſung for the dead, be wicked, and are to be abrogate.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That all Mens Traditions are to be rejected, at leaſt not to be reputed as neceſſary to Salvation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That conſtrained Faſts, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Meats, ſuch variety of degrees and orders of Prieſts, Fryars, Monks and Nuns, ſuperfluous Holy-days, ſo many ſundry benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and hallowing of Creatures; vows, peregrinations, with all the Rabblement of Rites and Ceremonies to be aboliſhed.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The ſupremacy of the Pope uſurping above all Churches, and eſpecially above all politick Realms, and Governments, not to be acknowledged; neither that any degree is to be received in the Church, but only Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Communion under both kinds to be neceſſary to all people, according to the Inſtitution of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:95405:56"/>9. That the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is <hi>Babylon</hi> ſpoken of in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and the Pope is Antichriſt.</p>
               <p n="10">10. They reject the Pope's pardons and indulgences.</p>
               <p n="11">11. They hold the Marriage of Prieſts and Eccleſiaſtical perſons to be pious, and neceſſary in the Church.</p>
               <p n="12">12. That ſuch as hear the Word of God, and have a right Faith, are the true Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> excommunicated <hi>Waldus</hi> and all his followers, They were diſperſed into divers places, of whom many remained long in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> who writing to their King <hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Reynerius,</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> Inquiſitor, under Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, writes of them thus. Among all the Sects that ever were, or now are, none is ſo hurtful to the Church, as theſe poor men of <hi>Lyons,</hi> for three cauſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe it continueth longeſt: for ſome ſay, it hath been from the days of Pope <hi>Sylveſter</hi> I. and others ſay from the days of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p n="2">2, Becauſe it is moſt general, ſeeing there is no Nation where it ſpreadeth not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whereas all other are conjoyned with blaſphemy againſt God, this Sect of the <hi>Leoniſts</hi> hath a great ſhew of Godlineſs: for they live juſtly before men, and believe all things concerning God, and all the Articles of the Creed: only they reproach and hate the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; and the multitude is ready to accept ſuch things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reynerius</hi> ſaith, there were accounted forty Churches defiled with this Hereſie, as he calleth it: and in one Pariſh they had ten Schools.<note place="margin">Verner in Faſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul. Tempor.</note> So <hi>He. Vernerus</hi> ſaith, there were ſome moſt ſubtil perſons among them, who endeavoured to maintain their opinions. And <hi>James de Rebiria</hi> ſaith, Becauſe they who were called Prieſts and Biſhops at that time, were ignorant almoſt of all things, it was eaſie unto the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> being learned, to gain the firſt place among the people.<note place="margin">Catal. Teſt. ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. li. 15.</note> Some of them diſputed ſo accurately, that the Prieſts permitted them to preach publickly.</p>
               <p>As for the continuance of this Sect in following times, one having inſerted the Confeſſion of Faith, which they ſent to the King of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary, Anno</hi> 1508. ſaith, It differeth not much from thoſe things that are now taught by Some, meaning <hi>Luther.</hi> And he addeth, that the

                  <hi>Waldenſes</hi> may be better known from that confeſſion, than by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of Hereticks, ſet forth by <hi>Bernard</hi> of <hi>Lutzenburgh.</hi>

               <p>His Companion <hi>Arnold</hi> went into <hi>Aquitain,</hi> and abode in <hi>Albium,</hi> whence the followers of him were called <hi>Albigei,</hi> or <hi>Albigenſes.</hi> Their liberty of Speech<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherewith they uſed to blame the vices and diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteneſs of the Princes of <hi>France</hi> and the Clergy,<note place="margin">Du.

                  <hi>Philip Auguſtus</hi> intending to declare his Son <hi>Philip,</hi> his ſucceſſour in the Realm,<note place="margin">M. Joan. Du. Tillet greffier en ſes memoires.</note> called a general Council at <hi>Paris,</hi> of all the Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Abbots, together with the principal Lords of his Kingdom. In this Council they treated of all things Temporal and Spiritual. Whence that appears to be true, which a learned <hi>French-man</hi> hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten long ago, <hi>That antiently the affairs of</hi> France, <hi>were managed by the Clergy, and Lay-men joyntly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Philip</hi> had put away Queen <hi>Iſabel</hi> his Wife, and married <hi>Alix</hi> the Daughter of the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> who lived not long with him. She being dead, he took <hi>Jugerberga,</hi> Siſter to the King of <hi>Denmark;</hi> whom likewiſe he put away, and in her place married <hi>Mary</hi> the Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Moravia,</hi> yet after a long and bitter contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie upon the repudiation of <hi>Jugerberga,</hi> he received her again, and ended his days with her. The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> vehemently purſued <hi>Philip</hi> in the Court of <hi>Rome, Philip</hi> prepares his Advocates to ſhew the reaſons why he had put her away. The cauſe was to be pleaded before the Pope's Legate, in the great Hall of the Biſhop's Palace at <hi>Paris,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De. Serres Hiſt. in vit. Philip.

As the Cryer had demanded thrice, if there were any to ſpeak for <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerberga,</hi> and that ſilence ſhould be held for a conſent, loe, a young man unknown, ſteps forth of the preſſe, and demands audience, it was granted him with great attention.</p>
               <p>Every man's ears were open to hear this Advocate, but eſpecially <hi>Philip</hi>'s, who was ſo touch't and raviſh't, with the free and plain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of this young Advocate, that they might perceive him to change his countenance. This Advocate having ended his diſcourſe, returns into the preſſe again, and was never ſeen more, neither could they learn what he was, who ſent him, nor whence he came. The
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:95405:57"/> Judges were amazed, and the cauſe was remitted to the Council. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> preſently takes Horſe, and rides to <hi>Bois de Vincennes,</hi> whither he had confined <hi>Jugerberga:</hi> having embraced her, he receives her into favour, and paſſeth the reſt of his days with her in Nuptial Love.</p>
               <p>An antient Hiſtorian ſaith,<note place="margin">Rigord. de geſt. Philip. Auguſt.</note> that there was a Council holden at <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> in which King <hi>Philip</hi> was aſſiſtent, with the Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, and chief Lords of his Realm, where the point of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce or confirmation of the King's Marriage with <hi>Jugerberga</hi> was diſcuſſed.</p>
               <p>After the death of King <hi>Richard</hi> I. of <hi>England, Philip Auguſtus</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome difference with King <hi>John</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> concerning the Dukedom of <hi>Guyen,</hi> and Earldom of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> which <hi>Philip</hi> ſuppoſed to belong to him, becauſe homage was not done for them; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Dukedom of <hi>Britain,</hi> which was confiſcated unto him by the murther of <hi>Arthur,</hi> King <hi>John</hi>'s Nephew, whom he had killed; he was ſummoned to <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Innocent</hi> III. upon the information made by <hi>John,</hi> ſuppoſing that the Pope ought to have the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their controverſie, by reaſon of an Oath upon the ſettling of the Lands formerly made between the two Kings, and the violation thereof: concerning which, he writ at large to the Biſhops of <hi>France,</hi> that they would approve of his proceedings, which was ſo well liked by his Succeſſours, that they Canonized his Decretal, which nevertheleſs hath been diſliked by ſome Divines.<note place="margin">Gabr. Biel ſupr. Canonmiſſae ſect. 75.</note> And for the <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt</hi>'s, ſome of them have ſaid, that the proteſtation which he makes at the beginning of it, contradicts the Act it ſelf; inasmuch as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares he will not meddle with the juriſdiction of <hi>France,</hi> which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs he did: for the feudal differences being determined by the Peers of <hi>France,</hi> betwixt <hi>Philip</hi> the Lord, and <hi>John</hi> the Vaſſal, yet the Pope would have his Legates to take cognizance of them: for heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en how he ſpeaks. That <hi>Philip</hi> would patiently ſuffer the Abbot of <hi>Caſemar,</hi> and the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Bourges,</hi> to have the full hearing, whether the complaint put up againſt him be juſt, or his exception legal. See what learned <hi>Cujacius</hi> obſerveth upon that Chapter. He proteſteth (ſaith he) doing one thing, and pretending another, not to intermeddle, nor uſurp the cognizance of the Feoffs belonging to the King, which he knoweth to appertain to the King and the Peers of <hi>France,</hi> but only to have the cognizance of the perjury. And he afterwards adds. All this he wrote to appeaſe the Peers of <hi>France,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cujac. in d. c. novit. de Judic. extr.</note> and bear them in hand that he proceeded juſtly againſt their King, and put all his Kingdom into an Interdict upon this occcaſion, yet for all that he gained nothing by it.</p>
               <p>In this Century, <hi>William</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Senon,</hi> wrote unto the Pope thus. <hi>Let your Excellency, moſt Holy Father, hear patiently what
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:95405:58"/> we ſay, for our Soul is in bitterneſs, and ſo is your devoted Son, the Moſt Chriſtian King of</hi> France, <hi>how all the Church of</hi> France <hi>is troubled with ſcandals flowing in time of your Apoſtle-ſhip, from the Apoſtolical See; ſeeing (as our Nation ſaith) Satan is let looſe there to the ruine of all the Church; there Chriſt is Crucified again, and manifeſtly ſacrilegious perſons and murtherers go free.</hi>

               <p>ALegat came into <hi>France,</hi> and commanded King <hi>Philip</hi> upon pain of Interdiction, to deliver one <hi>Peter</hi> out of Priſon, that was Elected to a Biſhoprick, and thereupon he was delivered.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1203. <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> loſt all his holds and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions in <hi>Normandy</hi> through the force of the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>
               <p>The Pope had Excommunicated King <hi>John,</hi> not only for the pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide of his Nephew <hi>Arthur,</hi> but alſo for the ill uſage of his Clergy. King <hi>John</hi> ſends confiding men in all haſt to Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> IV. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching him, to protect him againſt the King of <hi>France,</hi> promiſing thereupon to bind the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> and Seigniory of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to hold of him and his ſucceſſours, and in ſign of obedience to pay him a yearly tribute of a thouſand marks of ſilver. <hi>Innocent</hi> ſends his Legat preſently to abſolve him, to paſs the contract, and receive the homages of Fealty, as well of himſelf as of his Subjects. <hi>John</hi> is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and having laid down his Crown, Scepter, Cloak, Sword and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:95405:59"/> Ring, at the Legats feet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he doth him homage for the Realm of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> kiſſing his Feet as his Tributary, and binds the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to the like duty by a ſolemn Oath. He was willing alſo to diſcharge what he had taken from his Clergy. This was done, <hi>Anno</hi> 1215.</p>
               <p>Then the Legat returning into <hi>France,</hi> requireth <hi>Philip</hi> in the Pope's name, that he ſhould ſuffer <hi>John</hi> to enjoy his Realm of <hi>England</hi> in peace, and freely to poſſeſs the Lands which he held by homage of the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> Moreover that he ſhould ſatisfie the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints which the Clergy of his Realm had made againſt him, reſtoring that which he had exacted from them during the Wars, upon pain of Excommunication if he did not obey preſently. <hi>Philip</hi> promiſeth to ſubmit himſelf; and before the Legat's departure, he frees the Clergy of his Realm of the Tenths which he had exacted for the charge of the Wars, according to the decree of a National Council held at <hi>Soiſſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>John</hi> being freed by the Pope, and preſſed by him to perform his command, oppreſſeth his Subjects by extraordinary impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and Tyrannical exactions. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reject <hi>John,</hi> and offer the Realm to King <hi>Philip,</hi> who ſendeth his Son <hi>Lewes,</hi> giving him a train fit for his perſon in ſo great an exploit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lewes</hi> having taken Hoſtages of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for aſſurance of their Faith, paſſeth into <hi>England,</hi> and ſo to <hi>London,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. Weſtm. Il. 2. ſub anno 1215.</note> where he is joyfully received. In the mean time complaints come to <hi>Philip</hi> from Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> who in a general Council held at <hi>Rome,</hi> did Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate <hi>Lewes</hi> the eldeſt Son of <hi>Philip Auguſtus</hi> with all his adherents.</p>
               <p>King <hi>John</hi> dyeth, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> receive <hi>Henry</hi> the Son of <hi>John,</hi> and diſmiſs <hi>Lewes</hi> of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Philip</hi> inſtituted the Provoſt of Merchants, and the Sheriffs at <hi>Paris</hi> for the politick Government thereof: he cauſed the City to be paved, being before very noiſome by reaſon of the mire and dirt: he built the Halls and the <hi>Louvre.</hi> He Walled in <hi>Bois de Vincennes,</hi> and repleniſhed it with Dear and other Wild Beaſts: he finiſhed that ſumptuous building of our Ladies Church. In his Teſtament he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained many notable things: he left towards the winning the City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> III. C. M. pounds of <hi>Paris</hi> Money; to the Hoſpital in <hi>Mountfort,</hi> one C. M. pounds; and to be diſtributed among the poor Commons of his Land he gave XX. M. pounds. But a pound of <hi>Paris</hi> Money was then but two ſhillings ſix pence <hi>ſterling.</hi> King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> dyed and was buried with great pomp in the Monaſtery of St. <hi>Dennis, Anno</hi> 1223. and <hi>Lewes</hi> VIII. his Son ſucceeded him, who was crowned at <hi>Rhemes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> III. having gathered together an Army of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:95405:60"/> thouſand pilgrims, ſet forward for the final extirpation of the poor <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> The beſt Champions for the Pope herein were the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Nevers,</hi> St. <hi>Paul, Auxerre, Geneva, Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiers,</hi> with <hi>Simon</hi> Earl of <hi>Montfort.</hi> Of the Clergy, <hi>Milo</hi> the Pope's Legat, the Arch-Biſhops of <hi>Sens</hi> and <hi>Rovan,</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Clermont, Nevers, Lyſieux, Bayeux, Chartres,</hi> with divers others: every Biſhop with the Pilgrims of his jurisdiction; to whom the Pope promiſed Paradice in Heaven, but not one penny on Earth.</p>
               <p>Their work was to deſtroy the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> which were in great numbers in <hi>Daulphinè,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tho. Fullers ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly War. li. 3. ca. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Provence, Narbon, Tholouſe,</hi> and other parts of <hi>France.</hi> Their commiſſion alſo extended to the rooting out of all their friends and favourers, whether detected, or only ſuſpected; ſuch as were <hi>Reimund</hi> Earl of <hi>Tholouſe, Reymund</hi> Earl of <hi>Foix,</hi> the Vice-Count of <hi>Beſiers, Gaſton</hi> Lord of <hi>Bern,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Bigorre,</hi> the Lady of <hi>la Vaur,</hi> with divers others.</p>
               <p>The firſt piece of ſervice theſe Souldiers performed, was in ſacking the City of <hi>Beſiers,</hi> and Burrough of <hi>Carcaſſone,</hi> in which many of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> dwelt, and promiſcuouſly were ſlain with the <hi>Albigenſes.</hi> Yea, Prieſts themſelves were cut in pieces in their Prieſtly Ornaments, and under the banner of the Croſs.</p>
               <p>As for the City of <hi>Carcaſſone,</hi> which was not far from the Burrough, whilſt the City was beſieged, they eſcaped out by the benefit of a Vault under-ground, and ſo ſhifted abroad for themſelves. Hitherto this War was managed by the Pope's Legat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Simon</hi> Earl of <hi>Montfort</hi> is now choſen Captain of this Army, who ſwears to vex the Lord's enemies.</p>
               <p>After he was ſeized of the Vice-County of <hi>Beſiers,</hi> he took many other Caſtles and Cities.</p>
               <p>When the Quarantine, or forty days ſervice of this Army was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired (the time the Pope ſet them to merit Paradice in) they would not ſtay any longer, but ran away. And though the Biſhops perſwaded ſome few to ſtay, yet could they little prevail, which was no ſmall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the <hi>Albigenſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Earls of <hi>Tholouſe, Foix,</hi> and <hi>Comminge,</hi> and Prince of <hi>Bern,</hi> ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred themſelves under <hi>Peter</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> whoſe homagers they were, receiving inveſtiture from him, though their Dominions lay on this ſide the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Hills.</p>
               <p>This King ſuſpected the greatneſs of the Earl of <hi>Montfort,</hi> therefore he fomented a faction in them againſt the Holy Army: he charged Earl <hi>Simon</hi> for ſeizing on the Lands of good Catholicks, for ſuppoſed He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, and complained that the Vice-Count of <hi>Beſiers,</hi> who lived and dyed firm in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Faith, was lately trained into the Legat's hand, and againſt Oaths and promiſes of his ſafe return, was kept Priſoner till his death, and his Lands ſeized on by Earl <hi>Simon.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:95405:60"/>
               <p>A pitcht Battle was fought near the Caſtle of <hi>Moret,</hi> where the King of <hi>Arragon</hi> being wounded to death fell from his Horſe, and immediately his Army ran all away. <hi>Simon</hi> purſued them to the Gates of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> and killed many thouſands. The Fryars imputed this Victory to the Biſhop's Benediction, and adoring a piece of the Croſs, together with the fervency of the Clergyes prayers, that remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed behind in the Caſtle of <hi>Moret.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet within few years, the face of this War began to alter, for young <hi>Reimund,</hi> Earl of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> exceeding his Father in valour and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, ſo beſtirred himſelf, that in few months he regained what Earl <hi>Simon</hi> was many years in getting. And at laſt, Earl <hi>Simon</hi> beſieging <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> with a ſtone which a Woman let fly out of an Engine, had his Head parted from his body: Some conceived, they ſaw God's fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the Womans hand, that becauſe the greater part of his cruelty lighted on the weaker Sex (for he had buried the Lady <hi>La Vaur</hi> alive, reſpecting neither her Sex nor Nobility) a Woman was choſen out to be his Executioner. He dyed even then when the Pope and three Councils, of <hi>Vaur, Lateran,</hi> and <hi>Montpelier,</hi> had pronounced him Son, Servant, favourite of the Faith, the invincible defender thereof. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other of his ſtiles, he was Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Simon Montfort</hi> the <hi>Cataline</hi> of this Kingdom,<note place="margin">See Camden in Leiceſter-ſhire, alſo in Worceſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-ſhire.</note> who under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of curing this Land of ſome grievances, had killed it with his Phyſick, had he not been killed himſelf in the battle of <hi>Eveſham</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the third.</p>
               <p>Here ended the ſtorm of open War againſt the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> though ſome great drops fell afterward. And the Pope grew ſenſible of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miſchiefs in proſecuting this people with the Holy War.<note place="margin">Perin de Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſib. li. 2. ca. 4.</note> Three hundred thouſand of theſe croiſed Pilgrims loſt their lives in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition within the ſpace of fifteen years, ſo that there was neither City, nor Village in <hi>France,</hi> but by reaſon hereof had Widows and Orphans, curſing this expedition. The Pope therefore now reſolves upon a privater way, namely to proſecute them by way of Inquiſition. The chief promoter of that War was <hi>Dominick</hi> the Authour of the Order of the <hi>Dominicans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Mother being with child of him, dreamed, that ſhe had a dog vomiting fire in her Womb.<note place="margin">Du. Moul. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tr.

               <p>
                  <hi>Almerick</hi> for his lazineſs was depoſed by the Pope, and <hi>John Bren</hi> was made King of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> In the beginning of his Reign, this accident fell out: In <hi>France</hi> a Boy for his years went about ſinging in his own Tongue.</p>

               <p>Numberleſs Children ran after him, and followed the ſame tune their Captain and chanter did ſet them.</p>
               <p>No bolts, no bars, no fear of Fathers, nor love of Mothers could hold them back, but they would to the Holy Land to work wonders there, but this merry muſick had a ſad cloſe, all either periſhing on Land,<note place="margin">Math.

               <p>King <hi>Lewes</hi> VIII. having compounded with <hi>Almery,</hi> the Son of <hi>Simon</hi> Earl of <hi>Montfort,</hi> for <hi>Languedoc,</hi> reſolves to unite this rich Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to the Crown.</p>
               <p>To this end he levies a great Army, fortified with cruel Edicts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> as Hereticks, and Rebels. Count <hi>Reymund</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits himſelf to Pope <hi>Honorius,</hi> and yieldeth to <hi>Lewes,</hi> and perſwades the Earl of <hi>Cominges</hi> to the like obedience. Thus both of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon the people, and go to <hi>Rome,</hi> leaving the poor <hi>Albigenſes</hi> to the mercy of <hi>Lewes,</hi> who preſently ſubdues all <hi>Languedoc</hi> and <hi>Provence.</hi> The Houſe of <hi>Montlor,</hi> one of the greateſt in the County of <hi>Vivaret,</hi> having followed the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> party makes his peace, by means of the Town of <hi>Argentiere,</hi> given to the Biſhop of <hi>Viviers,</hi> who enjoyeth it to this day. Many Families were made deſolate: Theſe poor miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble people were diſperſed here and there; and ſuch as remained in the Country were forced to acknowledge the Pope's Authority. <hi>Lewes</hi> ordered the Marſhal <hi>Foy,</hi> of the houſe of <hi>Mirepois</hi> to command his Forces, leaving the Lord of <hi>Beaujeu,</hi> for Governour and Lieutenant-General of <hi>Languedoc.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this miſchief was contrived by the Pope, who had ſent his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat into <hi>France,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fox.

And in Monaſteries alſo after the like ſort, where the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot and Covent had divers and ſeveral portions, to require two Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, one for the Abbot, the other for the Covent, keeping this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, that how much ſhould ſuffice for the living of one Monk,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:95405:61"/> ſo much the whole Covent ſhould find for their part, and as much the Abbot for his likewiſe.</p>
               <p>The Clergy of <hi>France</hi> anſwered, that the thing he enterprized could not be brought to effect without great offence taken, and ineſtimable damage to the Church of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In concluſion, when the matter came to debating with the Legat, the objections of the inferiour Clergy were theſe following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They alledged the great damages and expences,<note place="margin">Math. Paris.</note> which they were like to ſuſtain thereby, by reaſon of the continual procurators of the Pope, which in every Dioceſs muſt live, not of their own, but muſt be ſuſtained upon the charges of the Cathredral Churches, and other Churches alſo; and many times they being but procurators will be found as Legats.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By that means (they ſaid) great perturbations might enſue to the Covents and Chapters of Cathedral Churches in their elections: Foraſmuch as the Pope's Agents and Factors, being in every Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral Church and Chapter-houſe, perchance the Pope would command him in his perſon to be preſent at their elections, and ſo might trouble the ſame by delaying and deferring, till it might fall to the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> to give, and ſo ſhould be placed more of the Pope's <hi>Clien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tele</hi> in the Churches of <hi>France,</hi> than of the proper Inhabitants of the Land.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By this means they affirmed, that all they in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhould be richer and receive more for their proportion, than the King of the Realm: by means whereof the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> would delay and drive off great ſuits, and would ſcarce take any pains with ſmall cauſes. Thus would Juſtice be turned aſide, and poor ſuitors ſhould dye at the gates of <hi>Rome:</hi> and for the better ſpeeding of their cauſes, they thought, ſeeing it was meet they ſhould have friends in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> by keeping them needy, their gifts might be the ſweeter, and their cauſes ſooner diſpatched.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Seeing it is impoſſible that the Fountain of greedy deſires ſhould be ſtopped, it was to be feared, that either they would do that by others, which they were wont to do by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or elſe they ſhould be enforced to give greater rewards than before, for ſmall gifts with great Rich Men are little regarded.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Whereas the removing away the ſlander was alledged which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> by this means rather the contrary were to be feared, wherein that ſentence was alledged.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:95405:62"/>
                  <l>Quòd virtus reddit non copia ſuſſicientem,</l>
                  <l>Et non paupertas, ſed mentis hiatus egentem.</l>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>That great riches ſtop not the taking of much, but a mind contented with a little.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. They added, that great riches would cauſe factions among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and taking of ſides and parties, ſo that by great poſſeſſions ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition might follow to the ruine of the City.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That though they would oblige themſelves to that contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet their Succeſſours would not be ſo bound, nor yet ratifie that bond of theirs.</p>
               <p n="8">8. They deſired the Legat, that the zeal of the Univerſal Church, and of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would move him: for if this oppreſſion of the Church ſhould be Univerſal, it were to be doubted, leſt an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal departing might follow from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which God forbid (ſaid they) ſhould happen.</p>
               <p>The Legat hereat excuſed himſelf, that he being in the Court never agreed to this exaction; and that the Letters came not to him before he was in <hi>France,</hi> and as for him he would ſtir no more in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, before it were proved what other Countries would ſay and do therein.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Lewes</hi> paſſing with a great Hoſt by <hi>Bourges</hi> and <hi>Nevers,</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Lyons;</hi> and from <hi>Lyons</hi> to <hi>Avignon,</hi> which for diſobedience to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had ſtood accurſed by the Pope for ſeven years. The Citizens of <hi>Avignon,</hi> ſhut their gates againſt the King and his Army, not ſuffering them to come within the City. Wherefore the King aſſaulted the City,<note place="margin">Fabian's chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic.</note> and loſt there many of his Men, among which <hi>Guy</hi> Earl of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Lemerick,</hi> and others to the number of two and twenty thouſand there were ſlain. In the end they ſubmitting to the King's pleaſure, and the correction of the Pope, an agreement was made; and the King and his Army were received into the City, and the Citizens received abſolution from the Pope's Legate.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Lewes</hi> to avoid the peſtilence that was in his Camp, went into an Abbey not far off, where ſhortly after, he dyed, and was carried to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he was interred, <hi>Anno</hi> 1226.</p>
               <p>Near unto this time, <hi>Gulielmus de Alta Petra,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> wrote a Book <hi>de Clero,</hi> wherein he thus ſpeakerh of the Clergy of his time. No godlineſs or Learning is ſeen in them, but rather all deviliſh filthineſs, and monſtrous vices; they are not the Church, but <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Sodom:</hi> the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prelats build not the Church but deſtroy it; they mock God, and they and their Prieſts do prophane
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:95405:62"/> the body of Chriſt; they lift up to the Heavens with all manner of Eccleſiaſtical honour the limbs of the Devil: in a word; they bring <hi>Lucifer</hi> into the Church of Chriſt. He taught alſo that there is no Law belonging to the ſalvation of man, but the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Lewes</hi> IX. called St. <hi>Lewes,</hi> ſucceedeth his Father in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>France,</hi> being but twelve years old, and was Crowned at <hi>Rhemes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is extant a conſtitution of this King <hi>Lewes,</hi> bearing date, <hi>Anno</hi> 1228. <hi>ſub. Tit. de Taliis,</hi> wherein he regrateth the Avarice of Popes; ſaying, that exactions, and grievous burthens of Moneys are laid on the Churches of our Kingdoms by the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereby the Kingdom is miſerably exhauſted. We will therefore, that theſe be levied upon no condition, nor gathered, except only for a reaſonable, pious, and moſt urgent neceſſity, and by our expreſs and willing conſent, and with the conſent of the Church it ſelf of our Kingdom.</p>
               <p>At that time the Senate of <hi>Paris,</hi> did preſent unto <hi>John Santroman,</hi> the King's Advocate, the Pope's Bull to be read and anſwered. He replyed, ſaying, The greateſt confuſion of all things would ariſe upon the accepting of that Bull: for by authority of ſuch in former times, the <hi>French</hi> people had in great numbers gone out of the Kingdom to <hi>Rome,</hi> of whom ſome became ſlaves or clients to the Cardinals; and ſome living more liberally, had idly waſted their Patrimony:<note place="margin">Brut.

               <p>The Pope's Legate having raiſed an immenſe ſum of Money in <hi>France, Lewes</hi> prohibited that the Money (which was yet in <hi>France</hi>) ſhould be delivered to the Pope's Aſſigns, or tranſported out of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>King <hi>John Bren</hi> reſigneth the Kingdom of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Frederick</hi> the ſecond Emperour. There was alſo a Peace with the <hi>Turks</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded for eight years.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Frederick</hi> recovereth all <hi>Paleſtine</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> without expence of time or blood: and concluded a ten years truce with the <hi>Sultan</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Pope's conſent.

But ſhort were the ſmiles of this City, which groaning under God's old curſe, little joyed her ſelf in this her new bravery.</p>
               <p>About the year 1232. the <hi>Greeks</hi> recover their Empire from the <hi>Latines,</hi> who had made an hard ſhift to hold <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> almoſt ſixty years under five ſucceeding Emperours. 1. <hi>Baldwin</hi> the firſt, Earl of <hi>Flanders.</hi> 2. <hi>Henry</hi> his Brother. 3. <hi>Peter,</hi> Count of <hi>Auxerre</hi> in <hi>France, Henry</hi>'s Son-in-Law. 4. <hi>Robert.</hi> 5. <hi>Baldwin</hi> the fifth, and laſt.</p>
               <p>At this time the <hi>Tartarians</hi> over-run the North of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and many Nations fled from their own Countries for fear of them. Among other, the <hi>Coraſines,</hi> a fierce and Warlike people, were forced to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their Land.</p>
               <p>Being thus unkennelled, they have recourſe to the <hi>Sultan</hi> of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> who beſtows on them all the Lands the Chriſtians held in <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> They march to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and take it without reſiſtance. Soon after the <hi>Coraſines</hi> elated herewith, fell out with the <hi>Sultan</hi> himſelf, who in anger rooted out their Nation, ſo that none remained.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French-men</hi> make War againſt <hi>Reymund,</hi> Earl of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> and think to encloſe him in his Caſtle of <hi>Saracene:</hi> but the Earl lying in Ambuſh for them in Woods, ſlew many of them, and 500 of the <hi>French</hi> Souldiers were taken; and of their Servitors to the number of 200 men in armour were taken, of whom ſome loſt their eyes, ſome their ears, ſome their legs, and ſo were ſent home: the reſt were carried away Priſoners into the Caſtle. Thrice that Summer were
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95405:63"/> the <hi>French-men</hi> diſcomfited by the aforeſaid <hi>Reymund.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Lewes</hi> puts a ſtop to the perſecution of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> ſaying, that they muſt perſwade them by reaſon, and not conſtrain them by force, whereby many Families were preſerved in thoſe Provinces.</p>
               <p>In thoſe times lived <hi>Gulielmus de ſancto amore,</hi> a Doctor of <hi>Paris,</hi> and Chanon of <hi>Beauvois,</hi> exclaiming againſt the abuſes of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> He wrote againſt the Fryars and their hypocriſie, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially againſt the begging Fryars.</p>
               <p>In his days there was a moſt deteſtable and blaſphemous book ſet forth by the Fryars, which they called, <hi>Evangelium Aeternum,</hi> or <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelium ſpiritûs ſancti: The Everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> or, <hi>The Goſpel of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Wherein it is ſaid, That the Goſpel of Chriſt was not to be compared to it, no more than darkneſs to light. That the Goſpel of Chriſt ſhould be preached but fifty years, and then this everlaſting Goſpel ſhould rule the Church.</p>
               <p>He mightily impugned this peſtiferous Book.<note place="margin">Fox Act and Monum. p. 410. ad 416.</note> He was by the Pope condemned for an Heretick, exiled, and his Books were burnt. His ſtory and Arguments may be read in Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> his firſt Volumn. Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> armed <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> and <hi>Bonaventure</hi> (men of violent ſpirits) againſt him, but he was too hard for theſe reprovers: his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers were called <hi>Amoraei.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> ſucceedeth <hi>Innocent,</hi> and is a great Enemy to <hi>Frederick</hi> the Emperour, who had entred <hi>Italy</hi> with a great Army. After his Election he ſends his Nuncio into <hi>France,</hi> to exhort <hi>Lewes</hi> to ſuccour him. The Pope comes into <hi>France,</hi> and calls a Council at <hi>Lyons,</hi> whither he cites <hi>Frederick,</hi> but yet upon ſo ſhort a warning as he could not appear. <hi>Frederick</hi> (having ſent his Ambaſſadours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a lawful time, and to advertiſe the Pope of his coming) begins his Journey to perform his promiſe. Being arrived at <hi>Thurin,</hi> he hath intelligence given him, that the Pope had condemned him as <hi>Contumax,</hi> excommunicated him, and degraded him of the Empire. But this was not without the conſent of the Princes Electors of the Empire, who after mature deliberation proceeded to a new Election. They chuſe <hi>Henry Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Thuring</hi> for Emperour; but he beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the City of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lmes,</hi> was wounded with an Arrow whereof he dyed ſhortly after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Frederick</hi> writes to the <hi>French</hi> King, againſt the ſentence againſt him at <hi>Lyons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the Electors choſe <hi>William,</hi> Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> for Emperour. In all the chief Cities, the <hi>Guelph</hi>'s Faction was the ſtronger, through the Authority of the Council of <hi>Lyons. Frederick</hi> over-preſſed with grief, dyeth, leaving <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> in great combuſtion.</p>
               <p>The Pope having Canonized <hi>Edmond</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> ſoon after <hi>Blanch,</hi> Queen Regent of <hi>France,</hi> came into <hi>England</hi> to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:95405:64"/> worſhip that Saint, repreſenting to him, that he had found refuge for his Exile in <hi>France,</hi> and beſeeching him not to be ungrateful. She ſaid, my Lord, moſt Holy Father, confirm the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> in a peaceable ſolidity, and remember what we have done to thee.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Lewes</hi> IX. came to aſſiſt the Chriſtians in <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> His no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility diſwaded from that deſign. <hi>Lewes</hi> takes up the Croſs, and voweth to eat no Bread, until he was recognized with the Pilgrim's Badge. Their went along with him, his two Brothers, <hi>Charles</hi> Earl of <hi>Anjou, Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Artois;</hi> his own Queen, and their Ladies, <hi>Odo</hi> the Pope's Legat, <hi>Hugh</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy, William</hi> Earl of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Hugh</hi> Earl of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>William Longspath</hi> Earl of <hi>Sarisbury,</hi> with a band of valiant <hi>Engliſh-men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Pope gave to this King <hi>Lewes</hi> for his charges, the tenth of the Clergy's revenues through <hi>France</hi> for three years, and the King em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed the Pope's Collectors to gather it; whereupon the Eſtates of the Clergy were ſhaven as bare as their crowns; and a poor Prieſt, who had but twenty ſhillings annual penſion, was forced to pay two yearly to the King. Having at <hi>Lyons</hi> took his leave of the Pope, and a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from him, he marched toward <hi>Avignon;</hi> Where ſome of the city wronged his Souldiers, eſpecially with foul Language.</p>
               <p>His Nobles deſired him to beſiege the city, the rather, becauſe it was ſuſpected, that therein his Father was poiſoned. To whom <hi>Lewes</hi> moſt chriſtianly ſaid, I come not out of <hi>France</hi> to revenge mine own quarrels, or thoſe of my Father, or Mother, but injuries offered to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. Hence he went without delay to his Navy, and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelf to the Sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lewes</hi> arrives in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> where the peſtilence raging, two hundred and forty Gentlemen of note dyed of the infection. Hither came the Ambaſſadours from a great <hi>Tartarian</hi> prince, invited by the fame of King <hi>Lewes</hi> his piety, profeſſing to him, that he had renounced his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm, and embraced Chriſtianity, and that he intended to ſend Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers to the Pope to be further inſtructed in his Religion: but ſome Chriſtians which were in <hi>Tartary</hi> diſwaded him from going to <hi>Rome.</hi> King <hi>Lewes</hi> received theſe Ambaſſadours cuurteouſly, diſmiſſing them with bounteous gifts. And by them he ſent to their Maſter a Tent, wherein the Hiſtory of the Bible was as richly, as curiouſly depicted in Needle-work, hoping thus to catch his Eyes, and both in his preſent; pictures then being accounted Lay-mens books.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> land in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Damiata</hi> is taken by them. Diſcords grew between the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the cauſe was, for that the Earl of <hi>Sarisbury</hi> in ſacking a Fort got more ſpoil therein than the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Then dyed <hi>Meladine,</hi> the <hi>Egyptian</hi> King. <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Artois,</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to King <hi>Lewes,</hi> fighting with the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> contrary to the Counſel of the <hi>Templars,</hi> is overthrown. In his flight he cryed to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:95405:64"/> the Earl of <hi>Sarisbury,</hi> flee, flee, for God fighteth againſt us. To whom our Earl, God forbid my Father's Son ſhould flee from the face of a <hi>Saracen.</hi> The other ſeeking to ſave himſelf by the ſwiftneſs of his Horſe, and croſſing the River was drowned. The Earl of <hi>Sarisbury</hi> ſlew many a <hi>Turk,</hi> and though unhorſed and wounded in his Legs, ſtood on his Honour, when he could not ſtand on his Feet; and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all quarter, upon his knees laid about him like a deſperate man. He fought till at laſt he breathed forth his Soul in the midſt of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. Of all the Chriſtians there eſcaped no more than two <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plars,</hi> one <hi>Hoſpitaller,</hi> and one common Souldier, the Meſſengers of this heavy news. The Plague ſwept away many thouſands of the <hi>French</hi> daily. Mean time King <hi>Lewes</hi> ſent many of the weakeſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple down the River to <hi>Damiata, Melechſala</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> meeting them by the way, either burned or drowned them all, ſave one <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh-man, Alexander Giffard</hi> (whoſe antient Family flouriſheth to this day at <hi>Chellington</hi> in <hi>Stafford-ſhire</hi>) who wounded in five places of his body, eſcaped to the <hi>French,</hi> and reported what had happened to the reſt. <hi>Melechſala</hi> came upon the reſt with an infinite multitude, and put them all (being few and feeble) to the Sword, taking King <hi>Lewes</hi> with his two Brethren, <hi>Alphonſe</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> priſoners. Then was there a general Lamentation over all Chriſtendom, chiefly in <hi>France,</hi> where all were ſorrowful.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melechſala</hi> is ſlain by <hi>Tarqueminus,</hi> a ſturdy <hi>Mammaluke,</hi> who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him in the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Kingdom. <hi>Lewes</hi> at laſt was reſtored to his Liberty upon condition, that the Chriſtians ſhould ſurrender <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miata,</hi> and he alſo pay back to the <hi>Turks</hi> many thouſand pounds, both for ranſom of Chriſtian Captives, and in ſatisfaction of the vaſtations they had committed in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lewes</hi> for the ſecurity of this Money pawned to the <hi>Turk,</hi> the Pyx and Hoſt (that is the body of Chriſt Tranſubſtantiated in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt) as his chiefeſt Jewel,<note place="margin">Du. Serres Hiſt. in Lud. 9.</note> which he ſhould be moſt careful to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem. Hence in perpetual memory of this conqueſt, we may ſee a Wafer-cake and a box, always wrought in the borders of that Tape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry which is brought out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence <hi>Lewes</hi> ſailed to <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> being forſaken of the Pope, Friends, Subjects, Brothers. <hi>Alphonſe</hi> and <hi>Charles,</hi> though ſent into <hi>France</hi> to ſolicite his ſuit, and to advance his ranſom with ſpeed, yet being arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved forgot the affliction of <hi>Joſeph. Blanch,</hi> the King's Mother, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gathered a conſiderable ſum of money, and ſhipped it for <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> a Tempeſt in a moment caſt that away, which her care and thrift was many months in getting. His Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> was with him, which ſomewhat mitigated his grief. Here ſhe bore him a child, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe another <hi>Benoni,</hi> or ſon of ſorrow, was called <hi>Triſtram.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Lewes</hi> being an excellent Antiquary, and Critick on ſacred
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:95405:65"/> Monuments, much employed himſelf in redeeming of old ſacred pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from the tyranny of Time and Oblivion.</p>
               <p>Mean-time, in his Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> hapned this ſtrange accident. An <hi>Hungarian</hi> Peaſant, who is ſaid to be an Apoſtate to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and well learned, gathered together many thouſands of people, pretending they had intelligence from Heaven to march to the Holy Land.

               </p>
               <p>Being to ſhape their courſe into <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> they went into <hi>France.</hi> They pillaged and killed the poor <hi>Jews</hi> as they went.<note place="margin">Magdeb. <hi>Cent.</hi> 13. ca. 16.

               </p>
               <p>In the Year 1253. was great contention between the Maſters of <hi>Sorbon</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> and the preaching Fryars, who were ſo increaſed in number and honour, becoming the Confeſſors and counſellors of Kings, that they would not be ſubject unto the former Laws and Cuſtoms. The School-men convened, and were content to want ſomewhat of their weekly portion to ſatisfie the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> from which the Fryars had obtained their priviledges.</p>
               <p>About this time or a little before, aroſe a ſtrife between the gray Fryars, and Prelates, and Doctors of <hi>Paris,</hi> about nine concluſions, condemned of the Prelates to be erroneous.</p>

               <p>Whilſt this King was gone to the Holy War, the Nobles of <hi>France,</hi> finding themſelves vexed by the Pope, made a league, and ſet forth a Declaration, againſt him, where they ſay (among other things) that the Clergy (pointing at the Pope) ſwallow up and fruſtrate the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of Secular princes, ſo as by their Laws, the children of ſlaves, paſs judgement upon Free-men and their children, whereas by the ſecular Laws of our Kings and Princes, they ought rather to be judged by us.</p>

               <p>Pope <hi>Clement</hi> IV. (born in <hi>Languedoc</hi>) being dead, the Cardinals diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree about the Election of a new Pope, and continued in this conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion two years, nine months, and one day, as <hi>Platina</hi> reporteth.</p>
               <p>The cauſes of ſo long a diſſention are variouſly reported by ſeveral Hiſtoriographers. But the chief were as follow.<note place="margin">Hiſt. of Cardinal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The firſt and moſt forcible of all, was the contrariety in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Cardinals which were preſent at the Election at <hi>Viterbo,</hi> who were eighteen in number; all obſtinate and untractable, and had ſworn each of them never to yeild to his companion in the leaſt.</p>
               <p>All of them believed themſelves worthy of the Papacy, and every one negotiated for himſelf, without ſpeaking a word of other preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſo that it was not poſſible among eighteen ſeveral competitors, to come to any reſolution. But that impediment being removed, in which the Cardinals continued obſtinate for above ten Months, there
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:95405:67"/> aroſe another which laſted above a year, and was the ſecond occaſion of the tediouſneſs of the Election, and that is, that the Cardinals were divided into two Factions, one of them <hi>Italians</hi> the other <hi>French.</hi> Theſe would have a Pope of their own Nation, and the <hi>Italians</hi> would have him of theirs; neither of them complying with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the number of the <hi>French</hi> being equal to the <hi>Italians,</hi> there being no way to gain the two thirds of their Votes, they remained divers weeks obſtinate, and doing nothing but the heaping diſſention upon diſſention.</p>
               <p>The other reaſon was, that this delay growing tedious to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and particular to <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi> theſe two Princes reſolved to come in perſon to <hi>Viterbo,</hi> and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the Cardinals to expedite the creation of the Pope. Upon this occaſion the Cardinals which were adherents to theſe two Crowns, having notice of their Reſolutions, would do nothing till they were arrived: who when they did come, ſerved for nothing but to protract the election, though their deſire was to haſten it; each of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending different perſons. The Princes finding all their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions ineffectual, returned as they came, leaving the whole buſineſs to the Cardinals.</p>
               <p>In the firſt aſſembly after the Kings were departed, <hi>John</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Porto,</hi> obſerving the pertinacity of the Cardinals, whilſt they were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether invocating the Holy Ghoſt, cryed out publickly, and with a loud voice. <hi>My Lords! let us uncover the Roof of this Chamber, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Holy Spirit will not come where we are thorow ſo many Roofs. It would be neceſſary to have a Holy Ghoſt for every one, ſeeing there is no two will agree: The Holy Ghoſt deſcended upon the Apoſtles, becauſe they were met together with one mind: but how can we expect him that are ſo ſtrangely divided?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At length the Cardinals being weary of going up and down to the places of their Aſſemblies, and doubting by their delay to bring in ſome new ſchiſm into the Church, two thirds of the Cardinals agreed in the Election, of <hi>Tibaldo Viſconte,</hi> a <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> Arch-Deacon of <hi>Lodi,</hi> who was called <hi>Gregory</hi> the tenth, not yet return'd from his Voyage into <hi>Aſia,</hi> whither he was ſent by <hi>Innocent</hi> IV. upon whoſe Election, Cardinal <hi>Giovanni del Porto</hi> made theſe Verſes.</p>

                  <hi>Norway</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> from each of theſe one.

               <p n="1">1. In this Council the firſt propoſition was for the Holy War, and for it they decree, that a tenth part of all Benefices in Chriſtendom (the priviledged Churches not excepted) ſhould be paid for ſix years. That all Penitentiaries, or Confeſſors ſhould urge offenders to aſſiſt that holy buſineſs with their wealth and riches: and that every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, without exception of Sex or Quality, ſhould pay a penny yearly during that ſpace, under pain of Excommunication.</p>

None of the Clergy ſhall without the Pope's licenſe, anſwer the impoſitions which ſhall be laid upon them by any Prince or State. 4. The mendicant Fryars ſhall be reduced to four Orders, the <hi>Minorites, Predicants, Carmelites,</hi> and <hi>Hermites</hi> of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who ſhall continue in their preſent Eſtate, until the Pope ſhall otherwiſe think good. 5. A prohibition was made, to admit or adviſe any new order, beſides theſe named. Here alſo was decreed the Union of the Greek and Latin Church, and the peace betwixt the Princes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom.</p>
               <p>But many of theſe Statutes in a ſhort time turned into ſmoak, plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities being of new diſpenſed, with the clauſe of <hi>non obſtante,</hi> which then firſt came in uſe. The Orders of Fryars and Monks were reſtored one by one. The <hi>Ciſtertians</hi> redeemed their liberty by payment of 500000 Marks.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bernardines</hi> paid 600000 Crowns, and other Orders made their compoſition. Whereby it appeareth, that the Statutes which were enacted, were only deviſed to raiſe ſums of Money, and not of any purpoſe to redreſs their abuſes. This Pope advanced the <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> highly, even to the wearing of red hats.</p>
               <p>In that Council of <hi>Lyons,</hi> Canons were made for the manner of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:95405:68"/> electing the Pope: for from <hi>Sylveſter</hi>'s time, unto this <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, they were not uſed to be ſhut up in a conclave; but if they were in <hi>Rome,</hi> the Electors met, either in the Church of St. <hi>John Lateran,</hi> or of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or in ſome other place as occaſion offered: if they were out of <hi>Rome,</hi> they met in the Cathedral of the place where they were, or in ſome other Church more convenient. But the Electors many times regarded not expedition in their Elections of the Pope,<note place="margin">Hiſt. of Cardinals part 3. lib. 1.</note> whilſt they had liberty to command, to go and come as they thought fit, therefore the invention of the conclave by <hi>Gregory,</hi> was rationally thought very good and neceſſary.</p>
               <p>There were likewiſe eſtabliſhed by the ſaid <hi>Gregory,</hi> ſeveral Laws and Orders for the conclave, which were afterwards by ſeveral Popes reduced into better form, till that in proceſs of time they were redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into that which I ſhall inſert in this place.</p>

If that cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly be done, let it be made in that City, to whoſe jurisdiction that place doth belong, provided it be not under interdiction: for in that caſe they are to chuſe another City in the ſame Dioceſs, or at leaſt not far off, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                           <p n="2">2. That after the death of the Pope, there ſhall be no diſcourſe of the Election of a Succeſſour, till ten days be paſt, in which time the abſent Cardinals are to be expected; and the nine days obſequies for the deceaſed Pope be celebrated with due reſpect, by all the Cardinals that are preſent in the place.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. That no abſent Cardinal ſhall ſend his Vote in any manner what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever: by which it is intended, they ſhall be deprived of their Voice as often as they are abſent from the Election.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. That the nine days ceremony for the death of the Pope being over, the Maſs <hi>Dello Spirito ſanto</hi> ſolemnly ſaid, and the prayer <hi>de eligendo Pontifice</hi> recited, let all the Cardinals which are preſent in the palace, which ſhall be called, <hi>the Conclave,,</hi> (which is to be in a ſecure place, cloſe in all parts, and well guarded) be ſhut in, with two or three ſervants only, for their neceſſities. Let it not be lawful for any to enter after the conclave is ſhut up, nor for any to come forth, except in the caſe of infirmity. And if any be obliged to go in or out, let it be by conſent of the whole Colledge. Nor is this conclave to have any Wall or partition, to diſtinguiſh one chamber from another: but let there be certain traverſes of Linnen or cloath, to divide their Lodgings, and they to be given to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:95405:68"/> by lot, to prevent all controverſies for place.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. That it be not only unlawful to Elect thoſe that are abſent, but that it be not permitted to the Cardinals to chuſe any but one out of their own Order, and of thoſe that are preſent in the conclave.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. If the Election be made in <hi>Rome,</hi> the place, the Gates and Doors of the conclave ſhall be well guarded.

If the Election be made out of <hi>Rome,</hi> the guard of the conclave is to be made by the Temporal Lords of that place, with the ſame formality and Oath as in <hi>Rome.</hi> The Guards are to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any violence ſhall be offered to the freedom of the Cardinals Votes; to obſerve what proviſions come in, that there be no Letters conveyed in them: and if any ſuch be found, let them be conſign'd to the Marſhal, to be kept till the conclave be finiſhed. That they take care that the Cardinals be not incommoded, that they be all ready at their beck; and in caſe of delay, that they force them (firſt with entreaties, and afterwards with threats) to haſten the Election. Thoſe who are appointed to guard the conclave, are to preſerve it from all violence and diſturbance.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. That the Cardinals may not go out of the conclave, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ their Aſſembly to any other place for any perſon whatſoever, the Election being ended, then they may go forth; if otherwiſe they ſhould go out, let them be forced back again by the guards of the conclave.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. That thoſe Cardinals who come after the conclave is ſhut, and before the Election of the Pope, may enter and give their Voices as the reſt. And that no Cardinal can upon any occaſion or pretence whatſoever (although he be excommunicated) avoid being preſent at the Election, and giving his vote.

That three days being paſt after their entrance into the conclave, if in that time the Pope be not choſen, the Prelates and Barons of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſuch others as are deputed guards to the conclave, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an account of the Cardinals tranſactions within, and reſtrain them of their variety of diſhes, reducing and leſſening them by degrees, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they find the Election delayed.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. That in the time of the Election, no perſon whatſoever, whether Secular or Eccleſiaſtick, is to give, promiſe, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,

               <p>Whence it appears, that ſeeing Chriſt as Man, had no power nor juriſdiction in Temporal matters, the Prieſt (be what he will) hath not received any power over them from Chriſt; inasmuch as he did not give unto them what he had not in himſelf.</p>

                  <hi>Peter Morone</hi> an Hermit, was choſen Pope, and aſſumed the name of <hi>Celeſtine</hi> V. a Pope little practiſed in politick or Eccleſiaſtick affairs.</p>
               <p>The Cardinals in ſhort time (by reaſon of the many errours that he fell into by his inſufficiency for the Popedom) made ſeveral Inſtances to him, that he would ſpontaneouſly be pleaſed to renounce the Papacy, and not expoſe the Church to ſo many perils.</p>
               <p>Hereunto they were ſtirred up by the inſtigation of <hi>Benedetto Gaeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> (who was afterwards <hi>Boniface</hi> VIII.)

               <p>The ſame day in which <hi>Celeſtine</hi> renounced, the Cardinals without the form of the conclave, choſe the ſaid <hi>Gaetan</hi> with open Votes.

               </p>
               <p>But before they come to Arms, Pope <hi>Boniface,</hi> ſhould make the firſt point by the luſtre of his Authority. This Pope commandeth <hi>Philip</hi> by his Nuncio to reſtore to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Flemmings</hi> what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and for not obeying, he cites him to appear at <hi>Rome</hi> upon pain of Excommunication. <hi>Philip</hi> ſends an honourable Embaſſage to <hi>Rome,</hi> by the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> and the Earl of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to lay open his right againſt the Deputies of the King of <hi>England,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> who were then at <hi>Rome</hi> to complain, as being wronged.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> being undaunted, prepares to defend himſelf, invades <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and defeats the <hi>Flemmings,</hi> ſeizeth upon all <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Flanders</hi> is forſaken by his confederates. <hi>Guy</hi> with his children and followers are impriſoned in ſundry places in <hi>France</hi> under ſure guards. <hi>Philip</hi> getting <hi>Flanders,</hi> and uniting it to the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> He comes to <hi>Gaunt,</hi> where he is received as their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, appointing <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Chaſtillon</hi> Lord of <hi>Leuſe,</hi> and <hi>Condè,</hi> for Governour and Lieutenant-General, and ſo returneth to <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The people of <hi>Flanders</hi> being oppreſſed, revolt from <hi>Philip.</hi> All the Cities (<hi>Gaunt</hi> excepted) make an offenſive and defenſive League

               <p>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> prepares an Army of 40000 Men, but even at his entry into <hi>Flanders,</hi> returns again.

Twelve hundred Gentlemen were ſlain by this enraged Multitude.

               <p>All the threats of the King of <hi>England,</hi> and the Emperour now va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed away: only Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> had Excommunicated King <hi>Philip,</hi> and interdicted his Realm in the hotteſt of theſe <hi>Flemmiſh</hi> affairs, upon this occaſion.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtians Eſtate was lamentable in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> the <hi>Tartarians</hi> encreaſed daily. The Pope, <hi>Anno</hi> 1301. ſent <hi>Boniface</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mea</hi> unto King <hi>Philip,</hi> requiring him to go into the Holy Land. When the Biſhop ſaw no appearance of obedience, he threatned the King, that the Pope would deprive him of his Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Biſhop being charged of Arrogancy and Treaſon,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:95405:71"/> and caſt into Priſon, the Pope ſends to him again one <hi>Peter,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> born (Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Narbon</hi>) commanding him to ſet the Biſhop at liberty, and to take a Voyage againſt the Infidels, and not to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the Tenths of the Clergy. <hi>Philip</hi> anſwered, his troubles at home hindred him from going into the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and conſtrained him to impoſe a Subſidy upon the Clergy: and he was willing to diſmiſs the Biſhop.</p>
               <p>The Arch-Biſhop replyed, that he was ignorant of the Pope's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, who was not only the Father of Chriſtian Souls, but alſo So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Lord in Temporal things.</p>
               <p>And therefore by that Authority he did excommunicate him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring him unworthy to reign, and his Realm forfeited to the Pope, to inveſt whom he pleaſed.</p>
               <p>Moreover, he brought another Bull directed to the Prelates and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen of <hi>France,</hi> whereby he acquitted all <hi>French-men,</hi> and diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with them as to their Oath of Allegiance to <hi>Philip.</hi> And cited all the Prelates and Divines of the <hi>French</hi> Church to appear before him at <hi>Rome,</hi> diſanulling all indulgences and priviledges granted to the <hi>French</hi> by any Popes his predeceſſours.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Artois</hi> diſdaining this affront, takes the Bull and caſts it into the fire. <hi>Philip</hi> was ſo born out by the Peers of <hi>France,</hi> that when he demanded their advice, how he ſhould demean himſelf, and whether he ſhould put up that wrong; they anſwered, That they were ready not only to ſpend their goods (which they there wholly offered unto him for that end,) but alſo to expoſe their perſons even to death for him, not refuſing any torments. Adding further, and that more plainly by word of mouth, That if the King (which God forbid) would ſuffer it, or connive at it, yet for their parts they would never endure it.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>John Tillet</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> ſpeaking of this Fact in his <hi>French</hi> Chronicle, The impudence of this man (ſaith he of <hi>Boniface</hi>) was wonderful, who durſt affirm, that the Realm of <hi>France</hi> was a Benefice of the Papal Majeſty. But I think them (ſaith he) the greater fools who diſpute the point, whether the Pope hath this power or no: he put our <hi>France</hi> under an Interdict for the time, but the Biſhops took the King's part.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Philip</hi> appealed from the uſurpations and inſolencies of <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> VIII. to the See Apoſtolick then vacant (as he ſaid) and to a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Council as <hi>Platina</hi> ſaith in his Life.<note place="margin">Platina in Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac. 8.</note> The States of <hi>France</hi> diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled <hi>Boniface</hi>'s excommunication. <hi>Boniface</hi> by a gloſing Letter of his written unto the Biſhops, endeavoureth to make them approve his unjuſt proceedings againſt King <hi>Philip:</hi> where he ſaith among other things; Thoſe who hold that Temporal matters are not ſubject to ſpiritual, do not they go about to make two Princes?

This <hi>Boniface</hi> was the Authour of the ſixth book of the Decretals.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Philip</hi> ſends back the Pope's two Nuncio's to <hi>Rome,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids the Prelates of <hi>France</hi> to go, or ſend any Money to <hi>Rome.</hi> This being done, <hi>Philip</hi> raiſeth new forces, to return into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dueth the <hi>Flemmings,</hi> but by the inſtance of <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> he makes peace with them upon ſtrict conditions.

               <p>After theſe and other Writings had paſſed to and fro, between the <hi>French</hi> King and the Pope, within a year and an half after, the King ſummoneth a Parliament, ſending down his Letters to his Sheriffs and other Officers, to ſummon the Prelates and Barons of the Realm unto the ſaid Court of Parliament according to the Tenour of the King's Letters Patents.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>William Nagaretta,</hi> Knight and profeſſour of the Laws,<note place="margin">Vid. Fox Act &amp; Monum. Tom. 1. p. 448.</note> made a large Declaration and appeal againſt Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> VIII. at <hi>Paris</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King and his Council.</p>
               <p>He taxeth <hi>Boniface</hi> to be an Intruder into the Papacy, that entring not in at the door, he is to be judged a Thief and a Robber. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares him to be guilty of many Hereſies, and to be an horrible Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack. He chargeth him with curſing and blaſphemy, a blood-thirſty man, a deſtroyer of the Churches, one that is very greedy after gold, and rooted in all ſins, that he is the <hi>Abomination of Deſolation,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by <hi>Daniel</hi> the Prophet.</p>
               <p>Then he thus ſpeaks to King <hi>Philip, I beſeech you, my Lord and King, that you would declare thus much to the Prelates, Doctors, People and Princes, your Brethren in Chriſt, and chiefly to the Cardinals and all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, and call a Council. In the which, when the aforeſaid</hi> Boniface <hi>is condemned by the worthy Cardinals, the Church may be provided of a Paſtor. And I beſeech and require the ſaid Cardinals by you, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them and the Church of God, that this wicked Man being put in priſon, the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>may be provided of a Vicar, which may mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter thoſe things that ſhall appertain, until the Church of God be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of a Biſhop, utterly to take away all occaſion of Schiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this proteſtation of <hi>Nagaretta,</hi> immediately enſued the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95405:73"/> of the King, pronounced and publiſhed againſt the ſaid <hi>Boniface.</hi> The manner and form is ſet down at large by Mr. <hi>Fox, Act &amp; Monum. Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 449. 450. This was done, <hi>Anno</hi> 1303.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Indictione prima, June</hi> 13. on the 14<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> day of the ſame Month of <hi>June,</hi> the aforeſaid King <hi>Philip</hi> being preſent, and alſo the Lords, Arch Biſhops, Biſhops, Abbots, Priors, and many witneſſes being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Pleſiano</hi> Knight, objected, propounded, affirmed, and read out of a certain paper which he held in his hand divers Articles againſt Pope <hi>Boniface,</hi> to the number of thirty, charging him with denying the immortality of the Soul, with aſſerting that Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is no ſin, charging him with Witch-craft, Simony, Sodomy, Murther, Oppreſſion, Bribery, Adultery, and many other deteſtable ſins.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being thus read and done, King <hi>Philip</hi> anſwered, and his Appeal is as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We</hi> Philip <hi>by the Grace of God, hearing and underſtanding the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons propounded by our beloved and faithful Knight,</hi> W. <hi>of</hi> Nagaretta <hi>againſt</hi> Boniface, <hi>having now the Regiment of the</hi> Romiſh <hi>Church,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>We earneſtly beſeech and require, in the Bowels of Jeſus Chriſt, you Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and other Prelates here preſent, as Children of the Church, and pillars of the Faith, that you would labour the calling and aſſembling of a Council; in which We intend to be perſonally preſent,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Then the Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Abbots, and Priors, anſwered the premiſſes, provoked and Appealed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And made an Appellation, Agreement, and proteſtation, as was contained in a certain paper, there openly and plainly read, in Tenour and Form following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We Arch-Biſhops of</hi> Nicoſen, Remen, Senorem, Narbon, <hi>and Biſhops of</hi> Landviren, Belnacen, Carolacen, Antiſidore, Meldimen, Nurmen, Chartres, Orleans, Anjou, Conſtance, <hi>with many others. And we Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots of</hi> Clugny, Proemonſtrator <hi>of the greater Monaſtery of the Court of St.</hi> Denis <hi>in</hi> France, <hi>St.</hi> Victor, <hi>St.</hi> Genoveue, <hi>St.</hi> Martin, <hi>&amp;c. and Fryar</hi> Hugh, <hi>Viſitor of the Houſes of the Order of Knights of St.</hi> John <hi>of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>in</hi> France, <hi>and the Father Prior of St.</hi> Martin <hi>in the fields,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Hearing theſe things which were ſaid, propounded, and objected yeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erday, and to day by you the Lords, Earls, and</hi> Wil. <hi>aforeſaid, againſt Pope</hi> Boniface <hi>VIII. &amp;c. We anſwer you, our Lord and King, and you, our Lords, Earls, and</hi> William, <hi>that (the Honour and Reverence of the Holy</hi> Romiſh <hi>Church ſalved in all points) we agree to your due Requeſt in this behalf for the calling of the Council, and are ready to aſſiſt to the calling together of the ſaid Council, according to the Decrees of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fathers, and to the lawful Orders of the Canons, not intending by
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:95405:73"/> any means to make parties of this matter, nor to ſtick to any that maketh parties. And leſt we ſhould be hindred by any means by the ſaid</hi> Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, <hi>by Excommunication, ſuſpenſion, interdiction, depoſing, deprivation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And that we may ſit in the ſame Council to judge and do all other things that belong to the Office of Prelates; that We, our friends, our ſubjects, Pariſh-Churches,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>may remain ſafe. We provoke, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal in Writing to the aforeſaid Council that is to be gathered, and to him that ſhall be the true and lawful higheſt Biſhop, and to him or them to whom of right we ſhould Appeal, and do earneſtly require our Appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: committing us, our Pariſh-Churches, and them that ſtick to us; our ſtate and theirs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to the godly defence of the aforeſaid Council, and of him that ſhall be true and lawful higheſt Biſhop. And we proteſt to renew this Appellation, where, when, and before whom it ſhall be thought meet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was done at <hi>Paris,</hi> at <hi>Lupara,</hi> in the Chamber of the King, many Lords, and Earls, Knights and Clerks, and others being Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>After theſe things thus in the Parliament decreed, and agreed; the Prelates conſulting with themſelves what to do in ſo doubtful a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and dreading the Pope's diſpleaſure for what was now done, to clear themſelves to the Pope, partly to certifie him what was done, and partly alſo to admoniſh him what he ſhould do, ſent this enſuing Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to him, thus directed.</p>

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:95405:74"/> to him (among other things) by the aforeſaid Cardinal and Letters, that for his Kingdom (which he and his Anceſtors hitherto do acknowledge they hold of God only) now ought in Temporal things to be ſubject unto you, and hold of you.</p>
                     <p>And ye have called to appear before you the Prelates and Clergy of the ſaid Realm, for the correcting of ſuch wrongs as ye pretend to be done to Eccleſiaſtical perſons, both Regular and Secular abiding within the Realm and elſewhere, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>Then the Barons having debated together on theſe matters, coming to our Lord the King, and thanking him for his laudable purpoſe, anſwered with one voice, that for thoſe things they were not only ready to offer to ſpend their goods, but alſo to yield their perſons unto death: adding; that if the King would ſuffer theſe things, yet they would not.</p>

               <p>In the next year, <hi>viz.</hi> 1304. about the Nativity of our Lady, came a number of Harneſſed Souldiers well appointed, ſent partly by the <hi>French</hi> King, partly by the Cardinals of <hi>Columna</hi> (whom the Pope before had depoſed) unto the Gates of <hi>Arvagium,</hi> or <hi>Anagni,</hi> where the Pope had hid himſelf. There <hi>Sciarra Colonna,</hi> Brother to the aforeſaid Cardinals, after many affronts done to his perſon and thoſe that were about him, and the plundering him of all his Wealth and Riches, carryed him to <hi>Rome,</hi> where at the end of 35 days he dyed of Anger, in the ninth year of his Pontificate: ſo that ſome took occaſion to ſay, he entred like a Fox, governed like a Lyon, and dyed like a Dog, he dyed <hi>October</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>The Cardinals went into the conclave the 21 of the ſame Month, and the next morning, they elected the Cardinal <hi>d'Oſtia,</hi> called <hi>Fra. Nicholas di Treviſo,</hi> of the order of the preachers, who took upon him the name of <hi>Benedict</hi> II. but he dyed in <hi>Perugia,</hi> in the eighth month of his Pontificate, in which City the whole Court being at that time, it was reſolved a new Pope ſhould be choſen: but they trifled away their time in diſputes and clamours for two months.</p>
               <p>The reaſon was, the Cardinals were divided into three factions: one ſtuck cloſe to <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi> who would have a Pope accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his way: another was for the principal Barons of <hi>Rome,</hi> and a third ſtood firm to the intereſt of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> who had ſent no ſmall ſums of Money and other preſents to Cardinal <hi>Pietro Colonna,</hi> to the end, that with <hi>James</hi> his Uncle, a Cardinal of the ſame name, they might keep up the intereſt of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At length Cardinal <hi>Peter</hi> corrupted ſuch with his gold, as he knew were covetous of it, feeding them on with promiſes beſides, ſo that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:95405:75"/> part of the Cardinals being faſt in thoſe Chains, and part of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timidated with the threats of the <hi>Perugians</hi> now in Arms, Cardinal <hi>Colonna</hi> propoſing the Biſhop of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> who was a great lover of the King of <hi>France,</hi> he was choſen by common conſent, and a Courier ſent poſt to him (who was then at his Biſhoprick) to know what name he would carry: he replyed, he would not change the name he was baptized with, which was <hi>Clement,</hi> and ſo he was publiſhed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to the people. and called <hi>Clement</hi> the fifth.</p>
               <p>After publication in the uſual place, the Cardinals diſpatched ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral meſſengers to the new Pope, to entreat him to haſten his Journey into <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Il.

               <p>This <hi>Clement</hi> was the firſt of ſeven <hi>French</hi> Popes, which held the See one after another, unto <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VI. under whom the <hi>Italians</hi> recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it again with much trouble. Theſe ſeven Popes were <hi>Clement</hi> V. <hi>John</hi> XXII. <hi>Benedict</hi> XII. <hi>Clement</hi> VI. <hi>Innocent</hi> VI. <hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Clement</hi> V. being choſen Pope, he came to <hi>Lyons,</hi> where King <hi>Philip</hi> received him, accompanied with the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Arragon</hi> in great pomp.</p>
               <p>The Pope was on Horſeback, and the King with his two Brethren on Foot, holding the Reigns of his Horſe. He was crowned in the Temple of St. <hi>Juſtus,</hi> where they had built a great Theatre for ſo goodly a ſpectacle. But the preſs of people was ſo great, that the Scaffold brake, ſo that the multitude ſell one upon another. The Pope; King, Princes and Noble-men were all on an heap, and the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold faſtned to an old Wall pulled it down. The King was hurt in the Head, the Pope in the Foot, and the Duke of <hi>Britain</hi> ſlain, with many Noble-men, and multitudes of the common people, that were ſmothered under theſe ruines. The Pope's Crown fell from his Head into the preſs, where he loſt a Carbuncle, valued at ſix thouſand florins of Gold.</p>
               <p>Thus this feaſt gave no cauſe of joy, but was famous to poſterity by this notable accident, and by the tranſlation of the Pope's ſeat from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Avignon, Anno</hi> 1305. unto the year 1379. under <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VI. <hi>viz.</hi> the ſpace of ſeventy four years.</p>
               <p>This unlucky pomp being ended, <hi>Clement</hi> created many <hi>French</hi> Cardinals (and not one <hi>Italian</hi>) and removed the Court preſently to <hi>Avignon.</hi> He avouched openly to keep a Concubine, the Daughter of Count <hi>de Fuxa;</hi> he ſent three Cardinals with Senatorial power
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:95405:75"/> to govern <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> He ordained, that none ſhould uſe the Title, or exerciſe the power of Emperour, until he were confirmed by the Pope.</p>
               <p>In the year 1307. a Parliament was ſummoned againſt Pope <hi>Clement</hi> by King <hi>Philip,</hi> touching temporal juriſdiction belonging to Princes, and Eccleſiaſtical belonging to the Church. Foraſmuch, as Pope <hi>Clement</hi> V. extolled himſelf above all Princes, as in other Countries, ſo alſo in <hi>France</hi> he extended his uſurped juriſdiction above the Princely Authority of the King, claiming to himſelf full government of both the States, as well Secular as Eccleſiaſtical; the King there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore directeth his Letters mandatory to the Prelates and Barons of the Realm of <hi>France,</hi> to aſſemble themſelves together at <hi>Paris</hi> in the Year afore-mentioned in the beginning of <hi>December.</hi>

His Oration is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into two parts. 1. He ſheweth, that obedience and reverence is due unto the King. 2.

               <p>All which he proved by many reaſons, both of Fact and Law.<note place="margin">Articles againſt the Clergy of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> His Oration being ended, he repeated certain words in the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, which imported, that the King's Will and pleaſure was in ſome points to renew the Temporal State and juriſdiction: and therewith he exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited a certain Bill in <hi>French,</hi> whereof alſo he gave a Copy to the Prelates, containing ſixty five Articles, which may be read at large in Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> his <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Monuments, Vol.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 462. 463. 464. 465.</p>

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:95405:76"/> long time appointed Judge over the people in Temporal matters. They aſſert alſo that Chriſt by his humane nature had both powers, ſhewing that he was a Prieſt after the order of <hi>Melchiſedeck:</hi> and that he had both in his veſture, and on his Thigh written, <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi> Many other places they cite out of the new Teſtament.</p>
               <p>Then they offer to prove it by the Civil Law, and by reaſon, and many places in the Canon Law: they ſhew, what priviledges of this nature had been granted to the Clergy by <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, King of <hi>France,</hi> by <hi>Lewes</hi> the ſecond, and by other Kings of <hi>France,</hi> which priviledges they offered to ſhew. Moreover they aſſert, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever things be offered up to the Church. and are converted to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and property of the ſame, be God's, and appertain unto him, forasmuch as they be ſaid to be dedicated and ſanctified by him. But this juriſdiction which is diverſly converted to the Dominion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the <hi>French</hi> Church, is God's, and therefore to be reſerved to and for him.</p>
               <p>They urge the King to conſider, that at what time he was crowned he ſware only theſe things following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he would defend and maintain the Canonical Law, privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Juſtice granted to the Biſhops, and the Church, and (as much as in him lay) to enlarge and amplifie the ſame. 2. Alſo that by his Arbitriment all Chriſtian people at all times ſhould keep the true peace of God and his Church. 3. That he ſhould forbid to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, all kinds of ſacriledges, ſpoilings and iniquities, and that in all kind of Judgements he ſhould will and command equity and mercy. 4. That throughout his whole Territory and juriſdiction, he ſhould labour to exterminate and cut off from the Church, the noted Hereticks.</p>
               <p>They argue alſo, that by the poſſeſſions of the Church, many Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Kinſmen of the <hi>French</hi> Nobility be maintained: <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſuch poſſeſſions are not to be grudged at.</p>
               <p>And becauſe a Bill of many Articles was exhibited, whereof part did infringe the whole Eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction, to the defence thereof (they ſaid) they would ſtand to the death.</p>
               <p>On the next <hi>Friday</hi> following, being <hi>Decemb.</hi> 29. the Prelates aſſembled themſelves again together at the King's Palace in <hi>Paris,</hi> where the Lord <hi>Peter Bertrand,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Eduen,</hi> ſpake openly before the King, ſitting with his Counſellours, and Barons about him. In his ſpeech he extolled the King's perſon, and his miraculous attaining to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> adding, that he ought to be the Champion and Defender of the Faith, all which he proved in few words by many
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:95405:76"/> reaſons and Authorities. Afterwards he touched thoſe propoſitions which were propounded by the aforeſaid Lord, <hi>Peter de Cugneriis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He beſought the King for his Souls health to maintain the rights and liberties of the Church; deſiring him to conſider what commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities he daily receiveth by the Church: and that his Church never failed him yet when he had need of the Laity; ſhewing the dangers and examples of them who did to the contrary. Further, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the King, to weigh how entirely his Lord the Pope doth love his perſon and Realm.</p>
               <p>After this, in the ſaid Seſſion, the aforeſaid Biſhop of <hi>Edven,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered particularly to the Articles exhibited by the Lord <hi>Peter</hi> in writing, to the King and Parliament. Which becauſe they touch more the ſubtilty of the Law, and ſtiles of the Courts, than are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to this our Hiſtory: and becauſe I would not burthen this Treatiſe with them, little profit being contained in them, I have here purpoſely for brevities ſake omitted them.</p>
               <p>The next <hi>Friday</hi> after this; the Prelates aſſembled at <hi>Vicenas</hi> before the King to hear their anſwer: Where the aforeſaid <hi>Peter de Cug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neriis</hi> (being Prolucutor for the King) ſaid that their King was to keep the rights of the Church and Prelates, which they had by Law, and by good a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d reaſonable cuſtom: where between the firſt and ſecond concluſion he went about to prove, that the cognition of civil cauſes ought not to appertain to the Church; for that ſuch things were Temporal, and ought to pertain to the Temporalty, as Spiritual things to the Spiritualty. And beſides his other reaſons, he alledged the 86. <hi>Diſtinct.</hi> declaring, that for this intent, the Clerks Crowns were firſt ſhaven, in ſign that they ſhould be free from all worldlineſs, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake all Temporal things. He added, that their Lord and King was ready to hear them, who would inſtruct him of any cuſtom, and thoſe cuſtoms which were good and reaſonable he would obſerve.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop <hi>Edven</hi> anſwered for all the Prelates, ſaying that the words of the Lord <hi>Peter</hi> engendred darkneſs and obſcurity, and might give occaſion to the Temporal Lords to break and infringe the Rites and Cuſtoms of the Church. As to that which was ſpoken, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſhaving of the crown, it was anſwered, that the crown did betoken rule and excellency; and the ſhaving did ſignifie, that they ought not to heap up Temporal things; ſo as to apply their hearts thereunto; but that the Temporal things ought to be ſubject to them, and not they to the Temporalty. After divers other ſpeeches, the ſaid Biſhop concluded, and beſought the King, that it would pleaſe his Grace to give them a more plain and comfortable Anſwer, and that they might not go away ſad and penſive out of his preſence, whereby occaſion might be given to the Laity to impugn the Rites and Liberties of the Church. In the end it was anſwered to them in the behalf of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:95405:77"/> the King, that his mind and intent was not to impugn the Cuſtoms of the Church.</p>
               <p>The Sunday following the Biſhops aſſembled themſelves again before the King at <hi>Vicenas,</hi> where the Biſhop of <hi>Senon</hi> in the name of all the Prelates gave humble thanks for it: and he beſought that ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations as were made to the prejudice of the Eccleſiaſtical juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction might be revoked and repealed. Hereunto the King himſelf anſwered with his own mouth, that they were not publiſhed at his commandement, neither did he know of them, nor ratifie them.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the Biſhop propoſed, that thoſe abuſes which the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralty complained of, ſhould be ſo ordered and reformed, that every man ſhould be content therewith. Finally he beſought the King, that he would give them a fuller and more comfortable anſwer. Then anſwered the Lord <hi>Peter</hi> in the name of the King. That if the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and Biſhops would ſee reformation of thoſe things which were to be amended (about which he would take reſpite betwixt this and <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> next following) his Majeſty would innovate nothing in the mean time. And if in the aforeſaid ſpace they would not correct and reform what was amiſs, his Majeſty would appoint ſuch order and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, that ſhould be acceptable both to God and his Subjects.

               <p>The Eccleſiaſtical Judges have ſince that time attempted to uſurp this juriſdiction over the Laity in caſe of Adultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the complaint which was made of it by <hi>Peter de Cugneriis,</hi>

And always whatſoever the Clergy attempted to meddle in ſuch matters, they have been prohibited by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon Appeals, as from abuſes, which have been put in againſt their decrees.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Clement</hi> had promiſed unto King <hi>Philip</hi> to aboliſh the memory of Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> VIII. and to anull all his Acts, but by advice of Cardinal <hi>Pratenſis,</hi> he delayed unto a general Council, and this he ſummoned to be held at <hi>Vienna</hi> in <hi>France,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Naucler. p. 872. and 878.</note> where the King required from the Pope the performance of his promiſe. The Council did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <hi>Boniface</hi> to have been a lawful Pope: but they did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare all his Acts againſt the King to have been unjuſt, and that none of them ſhould be prejudicial to the King, or to his Succeſſours. In this Council the Pope propounded the aid of the Chriſtians in <hi>Syria,</hi> the puniſhment of the <hi>Templars,</hi> and the reformation of the Church: Wars were proclaimed, and Indulgences were offered in theſe words. <hi>We Will, that the puniſhment of Hell, be no way laid upon him, who is
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:95405:77"/> ſigned with the Croſs, granting alſo unto every ſigned perſon power to pull three or four Souls out of Purgatory at their pleaſure.</hi> Hereat the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of <hi>Paris</hi> were offended, becauſe it was written in the ſame Bull, <hi>We command the Angels to carry the abſolved Soul into Paradiſe.</hi> It was then a received Article, that the Pope may command the Angels as his Serjeants. Pope <hi>Clement</hi> granted great Indulgences to ſuch as could not go, but could find Money for that uſe;<note place="margin">Out of an old <hi>French</hi> Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</note> ſo as he that gave a penny, was to have one year's pardon: he that gave twelve pence twelve year's pardon: and he that would give as much as would maintain a man going over Seas, a plenary pardon for all. The Pope appointed certain men whom he put in truſt for the receiving of this Money. Unſpeakable were the ſums of Money that were given for the purchaſing theſe pardons for five years together. At the end whereof, when the good men were ready to go, and perform what they had promiſed and vowed, the buſineſs was broke off, but the Pope kept the Money, the Marqueſs his Nephew had a ſhare of it, and King <hi>Philip</hi> the fair, and his three Sons, who had taken up the croſs to go thither in perſon, <hi>Edward</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> and other noble perſons ſtayed at home.</p>
               <p>In this Council it was ordained, that the feaſt of <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> ſhould be kept, with many Indulgences granted unto them who ſhould ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate this Feaſt.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Council Pope <hi>Clement</hi> V. ſet forth a Book of Papal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, called <hi>Liber Clementiarum,</hi> which was received,<note place="margin">Symſon Eccleſ.

Yet notwithſtanding the ſucceeding Popes, and particularly <hi>John</hi> XXII. confirmed and Authorized the ſaid Book again, together with the Decretals of <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Boniface,</hi> becauſe theſe Books highly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> exempting the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> from ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to general Councils, and attributing power to him to receive or reject the Emperour after he is choſen, comparing the Pope to the Sun, and the Emperour to the Moon.

               <p>It was alſo ordained, that Schools ſhould be erected, and foreign Tongues ſhould be learned, namely, the <hi>Hebrew, Chaldaick,</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> Languages.

               <p>Pope <hi>Clement</hi> having long ſojourned in <hi>France,</hi> had received many great courteſies from King <hi>Philip;</hi> yea he owed little leſs than himſelf to him. At laſt <hi>Philip</hi> requeſted of him a boon, great enough (ſaith my Authour) for a King to ask, and a Pope to grant, namely, all the Lands of the Knights <hi>Templars</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> forfeited by reaſon of their horrible Hereſies, and licentious living. The Pope was willing to gratifie him in ſome good proportion for his favours received, and being thus long the King's Gueſt, he gave him the <hi>Templars</hi> Lands, and Goods to pay for his entertainment.</p>
               <p>On a ſudden all the <hi>Templars</hi> in <hi>France</hi> are clapt in priſon, damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſins were laid to their charge; as ſacrificing of Men to an Idol they worſhipped; roaſting of a <hi>Templar</hi>'s Baſtard, and drinking his Blood, ſpitting upon the croſs of Chriſt, conſpiring with <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens</hi> againſt Chriſtianity, they were charged with Sodomy, Beſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, with many other Villanies out of the Road of humane corruption, and as far from Man's Nature as God's Law.</p>
               <p>The ſole witneſs againſt them was one of their own Order, a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Malefactor, who at the ſame time being in priſon, and to ſuffer for his own offences, condemned by the Maſter of their Order, ſought to prove his Innocency, by charging all his own Order to be guilty. And he ſwore moſt heartily to whatſoever was objected againſt their Order. Beſides, many of the <hi>Templars</hi> being brought upon the rack, confeſſed the accuſations to be true, wherewith they were charged. Hereupon all the <hi>Templars</hi> were moſt cruelly burned to death at a ſtake through all <hi>France,</hi> with <hi>James,</hi> the Grand-Maſter of their Order.</p>
               <p>Many men accounted not the <hi>Templars</hi> Malefactors, but Martyrs. Firſt, becauſe the witneſs was unſufficient, a Malefactor againſt his Judge; and Secondly, they bring tortured men againſt themſelves. And a confeſſion extorted upon the Rack (ſay ſome) is of no validity.</p>
               <p>But being burned at the ſtake, they denyed it at their death, though formerly they had confeſſed it.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Templar</hi> being to be burned at <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> and ſeeing the Pope and King <hi>Philip</hi> looking out of a Window,<note place="margin">Hoſpin. de Orig.

In like manner, <hi>James</hi> Grand-Maſter of the <hi>Templars,</hi> though by piece-meal he was tortured to death, craved pardon of God, and thoſe of his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, That forced by extremity of pain upon the rack, and allured with hope of life, he had accuſed them of ſuch damnable ſins where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:95405:78"/> they were innocent. True it is, they were generally cryed up for innocents.</p>
               <p>But Pope <hi>Clement</hi> and King <hi>Philip,</hi> were within the time prefixed ſummoned by death to anſwer to God for what they had done. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, King <hi>Philip</hi> miſſed of his expectation, and the morſel fell beſides his Mouth, the Lands of the <hi>Templars</hi> which were firſt granted to him as a portion for his youngeſt Son, being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the Council of <hi>Vienne</hi> beſtowed on the Knights-Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitallers.</p>

But for all his learned diſcourſe there was nothing done therein in that Council, Witneſs the Biſhop of <hi>Panor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo</hi> in his advice touching the Council of <hi>Baſil.</hi> This decree concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the general Eſtate of the Church; and the matters belong to a general Reformation, which may be hindred by a diſſolution, as it was by the diſſolution of the Council of <hi>Vienne.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Durand</hi> further ſaid in that Council, that the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Colledge of Cardinals, together with the Pope, would have a certain allowance of all Biſhops that are preferred there; it ſeems very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that this were taken order with. For this errour doth much corrupt the Catholick Church, and the common people: and the remedies which have been applyed hitherto are quite diſregarded, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the contrary is uſually practiſed in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> as if it were no ſin at all to commit Simony, or as if it were not all one to give firſt, and then take, as firſt to take, and then to give.</p>
               <p>The thing was taken into conſideration at the Council of <hi>Vienne,</hi> ſo as they were once adviſed,<note place="margin">Joann. Andr. in Ca. inter coer. de offic. ordinar.</note> to allow the twentyeth part of all livings in Chriſtendom to the Pope and his Cardinals: but at laſt it was ſhif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted off, without reſolving upon any thing. A Doctor of the Canon Law ſaith, it was better for that, <hi>becauſe their covetouſneſs is ſo unſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that if that had been reſolved upon, they would have taken both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Biſhop of <hi>Mende</hi> mentioned another abuſe fit to be reformed.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:95405:79"/> For, after he had ſaid, that every Biſhop's jurisdiction ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved entire to himſelf, he addeth, <hi>That Eccleſiaſtical Benefices, which belong to the collation and diſpoſal of Biſhops, are beſtowed by the See Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick, and others, even before they be void; and that not only in the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>but out of it; howbeit, the Biſhops muſt give account of the cure, and of thoſe that execute them, whoſe Conſciences they are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ignorant of, inasmuch as they are none of their preferring.</hi> He would never have demanded the reformation hereof, unleſs the abuſe had been notorious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Durand</hi> alſo perſwaded the abolition of <hi>Fraternities,</hi> for two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for their diſſoluteneſs, and for their conſpiracy againſt ſuperiours. <hi>It would be alſo uſeful</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that Fraternities,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Then ſpeaking of diſpenſations, he ſaith, <hi>That the very Nerves of the Canons and decrees are broken by the diſpenſations which are made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſtile of the Court of</hi> Rome,<note place="margin">Durand de mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do celebr. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.

                  <hi>that they are againſt the common good.</hi> And citing the Authority of St. <hi>Hierom</hi> writing to <hi>Ruſticus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Narbon,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Since Avarice is increaſed in Churches as well as in the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire, the Law is departed from the Prieſts, and ſeeing from the Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He gives us the definition of a diſpenſation according to the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, which he ſaith, <hi>is a provident relaxation of the general Law counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed by commodity or neceſſity: that if it be otherwiſe uſed, it is not a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation but a diſſipation, that the queſtion is now about the ſtaining of the ſtate of the Church; that thoſe who diſpenſe upon unneceſſary cauſes, do err.</hi> Laſtly, for matter of diſpenſation he would have that obſerved which Pope <hi>Leo</hi> ſaid, viz. <hi>That there are ſome things which cannot be altered upon any occaſion: others which may be tempered in regard of the neceſſity of the times, or conſideration of Mens Ages, but always with this Reſolution, when there is any doubt or obſcurity, to follow that which is not contrary to the Goſpel, nor repugnant to the Decrees of Holy Fathers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning Exemptions, he further declareth in that Council, <hi>That they give occaſion to the perſons exempted to live more diſſolutely, and more at their liberty. That they take away the reverence and obedience which the exempted owe unto their Prelates and Ordinaries,</hi>

                  <hi>and make them think themſelves as good men as the Biſhops, and other their ſuperiours. That the correction and puniſhing of faults and exceſſes is hereby hindred and brought to nothing; That they are prejudicial to the whole Church Catholick inasmuch as the exempted cannot be judged but by the Pope; and he cannot do it by reaſon of his remoteneſs from them; That they rob men of the means of doing many good works in Religion; That they are
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:95405:79"/> cauſe of many ſcandals. That thoſe to whom they are granted abuſe their priviledges: That they draw after them the ruine of Monaſteries, being rather a burthen than an honour or profit to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame <hi>Durand</hi> maintaineth, <hi>that the Pope hath no power to grant ſuch exemptions, conſidering that they overthrow the general order of the Catholick Church, which proceeds from God, the Apoſtles, the Holy Fathers, and general Councils, and which was approved and confirmed by Popes.

               <p>Pope <hi>Clement</hi> V. dyed, <hi>Anno</hi> 1314. after whoſe death the Papacy ſtood void two years and three months. The Cardinals at laſt did yield all their ſuffrages unto <hi>Jacob de Oſſa Cardurcenſis,</hi> who afterwards went up into the Papal Chair, and ſaid, <hi>I am Pope.</hi> This was <hi>John</hi> XXII. He was a <hi>Ciſtercian</hi> Monk, he ſate in that ſeat eighteen years.</p>
               <p>This <hi>John</hi> believed, that the Souls do not enjoy the preſence of God before the day of Judgement. He ſent two Preachers to <hi>Paris,</hi> the one a <hi>Dominican,</hi> the other a <hi>Franciſcan,</hi> to aſſert and maintain the ſame Hereſie.</p>
               <p>But one <hi>Thomas,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Preacher, withſtood the Pope; and the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:95405:80"/> Pope threw him into priſon. Hereupon the <hi>French</hi> King ſummoned a Council unto his palace in <hi>Vintiana Sylva,</hi> the whole Aſſembly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed againſt the Pope.

               <p>
                  <hi>Clement</hi> V. predeceſſour to this Pope, had ordained, that Emperours by the <hi>German</hi> Princes elected, might be called Kings of the <hi>Romans,</hi> but might not enjoy the Title or right of the Empire to be nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Emperours, without their confirmation given by the Pope. Wherefore becauſe <hi>Lewes</hi> of <hi>Bavaria</hi> being choſen Emperour uſed the Imperial dignity in <hi>Italy,</hi> before he was authorized by the Pope, the ſaid Pope <hi>John</hi> therefore Excommunicated the Emperour, who often deſired of him a Treaty of peace, which the Pope refuſed to hearken to. At the ſame time divers learned Men diſallowed the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Pope, as <hi>William Ocham,</hi> whoſe tranſactions were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward condemned by the Pope for writing againſt that See: and <hi>Marſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Pativinus,</hi> who wrote the Book entituled, <hi>Defenſor pacis,</hi> which was put into the hands of the ſaid Emperour; wherein the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of the Pope's unlawful juriſdiction in things Temporal is largely diſputed, and the uſurped Authority of that See is ſet forth to the uttermoſt. Some Writers ſay, that a great cauſe of the variance was, for that one of the Emperour's Secretaries (unknown to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour) had likened in (divers of his Letters) the Papal See to the Beaſt riſing out of the Sea in the <hi>Apocalypſe.</hi> At length when the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, after much ſuit made to the Pope at <hi>Avignon,</hi> could not obtain his Coronation from him, he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was received with great honour; and both he and his Wife were both crowned by the conſent of all the Lords and Cardinals there; and another Pope was there ſet up, called <hi>Nicholas</hi> V.</p>
               <p>Not long after Pope <hi>John</hi> dyeth at <hi>Avignon,</hi> after whom ſucceedeth <hi>Benedict</hi> XII. <hi>Anno</hi> 1335.</p>
               <p>This Man was as uncourteous to the Emperour as <hi>John</hi> had been,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:95405:80"/> he renewed the curſes againſt him, bereft him of all Regal Dignity, and by his ſentence deprived him of the Dukedom of <hi>Bavaria.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Emperour cometh into <hi>Germany,</hi> and aſſembleth the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Dukes, Nobles, Biſhops, and other learned men in a Council at <hi>Franckford,</hi> where he cauſed an injunction to be diſpatched, wherein he affirmed the ſentence pronounced againſt him unjuſt, and that his Excommunication did no way bind him.</p>
               <p>Wherefore he commanded upon great penalties, that no man ſhould obey his cenſures and interdictions in that behalf, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction cauſed great alterations in <hi>Germany,</hi> eſpecially among the Clergy, ſome holding with the Emperour, others with the Pope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dantes,</hi> a man of profound Learning, at that time wrote a Book, called, <hi>The Monarchy,</hi> wherein he favoured the Emperour; for which he was afterward condemned, and his Book held for Hereſie.

                  <hi>Philip the Hardy</hi> had left two Sons, <hi>Philip</hi> the fair, and <hi>Charles</hi> Earl of <hi>Valois;</hi> of whom it is ſaid, that he was the Son of a King, Brother to a King, Unckle to a King, Father to a King, and yet no King. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> the Son of <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Valois</hi> is ſaluted and proclaimed King of <hi>France,</hi> and anointed and crowned at <hi>Rhemes</hi> according to the uſual cuſtom.</p>
               <p>Near the beginning of his Reign,<note place="margin">De Serres Hiſt. in vit.

The ſuit was vehement, and famous for the greatneſs of the parties. The King to reconcile this quarrel, calls a general Aſſembly of his whole Realm at <hi>Paris.</hi> The cauſe was pleaded before him with great liberty by <hi>Peter de Cugneriis</hi> (this is He whom in deriſion they call M. <hi>Peter Cugnet,</hi> who is in the great Temple in <hi>Paris,</hi> noted with a little Monkey's head, placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two pillars to put out the Candles, being odious by reaſon of his pleading) and as coldly defended by <hi>Peter Bertrand,</hi> both famous Advocates in thoſe times.

               <p>This Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> took from the Emperour the Senatourſhip of <hi>Rome:</hi> he firſt took upon him to uſurp the preſentments of all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks.

               <p>About this time <hi>Hayabad</hi> a <hi>Franciſcan,</hi> preached in <hi>Avignon</hi> before Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> that he was commanded by God to declare,<note place="margin">Catal.

               <p>
                  <hi>John Rochetalada,</hi> another <hi>Franciſcan,</hi> preached the ſame, and is ſaid to be one of them who were burnt at <hi>Avignon. Anno</hi> 1353.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time <hi>Gregory de Arimino</hi> oppoſed the Doctors in the Articles of Juſtification by works, and of free will.

And he ſaid the Schoolmen deſerve to be called <hi>Semipelagians. Andreas de Caſtro,</hi> and <hi>John Buridan,</hi> two famous Men at that time, agreed with him.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Eudo</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> perſwaded the <hi>French</hi> King that he ſhould not receive into his Realm the new Decretals and Extravagants. His ſage advice is extant among the Records of <hi>France.</hi>

Many others of the Nobles of <hi>France</hi> were alſo taken Captive. 1700 Gentlemen were ſlain in this Battle, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which were 52 Lords. King <hi>John</hi> continued five years a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, for he was taken in <hi>September, Anno</hi> 1356. and delivered in <hi>May, Anno</hi> 1361.</p>
               <p>There hapned in <hi>France</hi> a certain contention, between the <hi>French</hi> Prelates, and the Fryars of <hi>Paris.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> Prelates aſſembling in the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> cauſed by the Bedles to be called together all the Students, Maſters and Batchellors of every faculty, with the chief heads of all the Religious Houſes and Fryars of the Univerſity of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi> Who being all congregated in the Biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> his houſe, where there were preſent four Arch-Biſhops, and twenty Biſhops, the Biſhop of <hi>Biture</hi> preached to the Students of <hi>Paris</hi> againſt the Fryars.</p>
               <p>He told them that true charity would compel them to provide for their flocks, to withſtand errours; that they were bound to give their lives for the flock committed to their charge.</p>
               <p>That no Man ought to buſie himſelf with what belonged not to his Office. For thereby (ſaith he) all Eccleſiaſtical Order is diſſolved. He ſhewed how the <hi>Dominican</hi> and <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Fryars did uſurp what belonged to the Prelates. They charged the Fryars for preaching againſt their wills throughout all their Dioceſſes, and for hearing confeſſions, ſaying, that they have the Pope's priviledge to bear them out therein.</p>
               <p>Then ſtood up another in the publick place, and read the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of both the orders, and afterwards read the conſtitution of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> III. written in the fifth of the <hi>Decretals.</hi> Which conſtitution was repugnant and contrary to the aforeſaid priviledges. Then roſe up the Biſhop of <hi>Ambian,</hi> a great Lawyer, who diſcourſing from Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle to Article, there proved by good Law, that the ſaid conſtitution ſtood in it's full force and vigour, and ought not to be infringed by the Fryars priviledges in any part: and therefore by vertue of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, the Fryars ought not ſo miſorderly to hear confeſſions, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn pennance, and preach in Churches without ſpecial licence of the Biſhop of the Dioceſs, and leave from the Curate of the Pariſh: unto whoſe words none of the Fryars replyed at that time. So the Biſhop proceeding to the concluſion, deſired the Univerſity to aſſiſt them in that caſe, wherein they were all determined to ſtand firmly to the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:95405:82"/> of their blood in reſiſting that intruſion of the Fryars. This hapned on <hi>Decemb.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>The next day being <hi>Sunday,</hi> one of the Order of the <hi>Minorites,</hi> or <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> went to the Church of the <hi>Majorites,</hi> or preaching Fryars, where he made a Sermon (which was never ſeen before, for the one Order to come and reſort to the other) beginning in the aforeſaid mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to reply, and to expound in order through every Article, adding moreover, that they went not ſo far in their priviledges as they law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully might. And ſaid, that when they obtained thoſe priviledges in <hi>Rome,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Ambian</hi> was there preſent himſelf, reſiſting the ſame with all his power: yea all the Prelates of <hi>France</hi> ſent and wrote up to the Court againſt the ſame, and yet did not prevail. For when the Fryars there declared to the Pope how far they had uſed their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, the Pope at the ſame time ſaid, <hi>Placet,</hi> ſhewing that he agreed unto the ſame.</p>
               <p>And now (ſaith he) the Prelates demand of us to ſend up our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges to the Court, which were great folly in us; for in ſo doing we ſhould give way to the revoking the Authority which is given into our hands already. Moreover, our Warden and Maſter, is now lately dead, and the Maſter of the <hi>Dominican</hi> Fryars here is not now preſent: wherefore we dare not determine in ſo weighty a cauſe (touching the priviledges of our order) without the preſence of them. And therefore we deſire you of the Univerſity to hold us excuſed, who are not the worſt part of the Univerſity.</p>
               <p>The next day being the eighth of the ſame month it was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that one of the <hi>Dominick</hi> Fryars ſhould preach in the Church of the <hi>Franciſcan,</hi> or Gray-Fryars, and ſo he did, going the ſame way as the other Fryar had done before in the other Church.</p>
               <p>All the Heads of the Univerſity met together on the Vigil of St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s day in St. <hi>Bernard</hi>'s Church at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>A Sermon was preached by a Divine of the Univerſity, wherein he with many words and great Authorities, argued againſt them that would not be obedient to their Prelates. The Biſhop of <hi>Ambian</hi> (the Sermon being ended) proſecuted the ſame Argument. And in concluſion the Fryars priviledges were in diſputation confuted at <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Certain Articles had formerly been given out againſt the Fryars by the Students of <hi>Paris,</hi> why they ſhould not be admitted to their Society.</p>
               <p n="1">1, Say they, our Society ought not to be Co-active, but free and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary.</p>

                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:95405:83"/>3. Seeing they are of a diverſe profeſſion from us (for they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Regular,</hi> and not <hi>Scholaſtical</hi>) we ought not therefore to aſſociate together in one Scholaſtical Office.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe they work diſſentions and offences, therefore we ought to avoid them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Becauſe they devour Mens houſes, ſearching and ſacking the Eſtates and Conſciences of all perſons, circumventing thoſe whom they find eaſie to be ſeduced, and leading them from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of their Prelates.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They ſuggeſt, that the Fryars are falſe Prophets, who being neither Biſhops, nor Pariſh-prieſts, nor yet their Vicars, nor ſent by them, yet they preach <hi>(not ſent)</hi> againſt the mind of the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Becauſe they are ſo curious in ſearching and enquiring out other Mens doings and ſpiritual demeanour: Wherefore ſeeing them in no order, we are by the ſentence of the Apoſtle commanded to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void them.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe Articles above rehearſed, certain propoſitions were propoſed in the Schools of <hi>Paris,</hi> ſolemnly to be diſputed and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt the Fryars, which were theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the begging Fryars were not in a ſtate of Salvation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they were bound to labour with their hands that could, and not to beg.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That they ought not to preach, or hear the confeſſions of any, although they be Licenſed thereunto by the Pope, or by the Dioceſſan, forasmuch as the ſame is prejudicial to the Miniſters and Prieſts of the Pariſhes.</p>
               <p>All thoſe aforeſaid Articles and concluſions, Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> IV. had condemned to be aboliſhed and burnt, writing his precepts to the <hi>French</hi> King, and the Univerſity of <hi>Paris</hi> in favour of the Fryars, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding all Liberties and priviledges to be reſtored to the ſaid Fryars. Another priviledge was given to the Fryars by Pope <hi>Clement</hi> IV. who ſucceeded <hi>Alexander</hi> IV. <hi>Anno</hi> 1263.</p>
               <p>But in the year 1281. Pope <hi>Martin</hi> IV. renewed again the Canon in behalf of the Curates againſt the Fryars.</p>
               <p>In the year 1294. <hi>Boniface</hi> VIII. granted to the Fryars, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out licence of Vicars of Churches, they ſhall firſt preſent themſelves to the Prelates to be admitted; by whom if they be refuſed the ſecond time, then they upon ſpecial Authority of this Pope ſhall be privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged without either Biſhop or Curate, to preach, to bury, and to hear confeſſions from any that ſhall come unto them: ſo revoking all
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:95405:83"/> that was decreed by his predeceſſours to the contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1303. Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> II. revoked the conſtitution of <hi>Boniface</hi> his predeceſſour. Then followed Pope <hi>Clement</hi> V. who in his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council holden at <hi>Vienna</hi> revoked the conſtitution of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedict</hi> his predeceſſour, and renewed again the former decree of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this variable diverſity of the Popes (one diſſenting from and repugning another) aroſe among the Divines and Schoolmen in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities great matter of contention, in the Univerſities of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> about the begging Fryars, ſome holding one way ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
               <p>Five principal opinions be noted of learned men, who then diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt the Fryars, were condemned for Hereticks, and their aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions reproved.</p>
               <p>The firſt was the opinion of them which defended that the Fryars might not by the licence of the Pope and of the Prelates, preach in Pariſhes, and hear confeſſion.</p>
               <p>Of this opinion was <hi>William de ſancto âmore</hi> with his fellows, who had been condemned.</p>
               <p>The ſecond opinion was, that Fryars, although not by their own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, yet by priviledge of the Pope, and of the Biſhop, might preach and hear confeſſions in Pariſhes, but yet not without licence of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh-prieſts. Of this opinion was St. <hi>Bernard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third opinion was, that Fryars might preach and hear confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without Licence of the Pariſh-prieſts; but yet the ſaid Pariſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners notwithſtanding were bound by the Canon <hi>[omnis utriuſque ſex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us]</hi> to repeat the ſame ſins again, if they had no other to their own proper Curate. And of this opinion were many, as <hi>Godfr. de fontibus: Henr. de Gandavo, Joannes Monach. Cardin. Joannes de Poliaco.</hi> Pope <hi>John</hi> XXII. cauſed <hi>John de Poliaco,</hi> openly io retract in <hi>Paris.</hi> The Aſſertions which he held were theſe.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>The firſt was, they which were confeſſed to Fryars, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though having a general Licence to hear confeſſions,<note place="margin">Fox Act &amp; Monum.</note> were bound again to confeſs their ſins to their own Pariſh-prieſt by the aforenamed Canon.</item>
                  <item>The ſecond was, that the ſaid Canon, ſtanding in force, Pariſhioners were bound once in a year to confeſs their ſins to their Prieſt. For the doing otherwiſe importeth a contradiction in it ſelf.</item>
                  <item>The third was, that the Pope could not give general licence to hear confeſſions ſo, but that the Pariſhoner ſo confeſſed was bound to reiterate the ſame confeſſion made
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:95405:84"/> unto his own Curate. Which he proved by divers places of the Canon Law.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The fourth opinion was, that the Fryars by the Licence of the Pope and of the Biſhops, might lawfully hear confeſſions, and the people might be of them confeſſed and abſolved. But yet notwithſtanding it was juſt, honeſt, and profitable, that once in the year they ſhould be confeſſed to the Curates (although confeſſed before to the Fryars,) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the admininiſtration of the Sacraments, eſpecially at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> of which opinion was <hi>William de monte Landuno.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth opinion was, that albeit the Fryars might at all times, and at <hi>Eaſter</hi> alſo hear confeſſions, as the Curates did, yet it was ſafer at the time of <hi>Eaſter</hi> to confeſs to the Curates than to the Fryars. And of this opinion was <hi>Richard</hi> of <hi>Armagh,</hi> Arch-Biſhop and Primate of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the time of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> VI. <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> invented the Sect and Order of thoſe Monks,<note place="margin">Sympſon Eccleſ. Hiſt. p. 391.</note> which are called <hi>Stellati,</hi> whoſe manner is always to wear a ſtar upon their Breaſt, ſignifying thereby, that there is nothing in them but the light of perfection, and the clear ſhining of good works: yea, that they themſelves are the light of the World. <hi>Item,</hi> That they ſhall riſe again at the laſt day all ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and gliſtering, as the moſt clear and pleaſant ſtars, according as it is written, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3. <hi>They that turn many unto Righteouſneſs, ſhall be as the ſtars for ever and ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the death of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> VI. ſucceeded <hi>Innocent</hi> VI. before whom the aforeſaid <hi>Richard</hi> of <hi>Armagh</hi> publiſhed nine Articles againſt the begging Fryars. This Pope builded Walls about <hi>Avignon,</hi> and founded an houſe of <hi>Carthuſian</hi> Monks without the City.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> V. ſucceeded him, <hi>Anno</hi> 1364. <hi>Nicholas Orem</hi> made a Sermon before the Pope and his Cardinals on <hi>Chriſtmas</hi>-even, in which he rebuketh the Prelates and Prieſts of his time, declaring their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction not to be far off, by certain ſigns taken of their wicked and corrupt life. He proveth the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Clergy to be ſo much worſe than the old Synagogue of the <hi>Jews,</hi> by how much it is worſe to ſell the Church and Sacraments: than to ſuffer Doves to be ſold in the Church.</p>
               <p>In the year 1370. <hi>Peter Belfort</hi> of <hi>Lemouſin,</hi> who took the name of <hi>Gregory</hi> XI. was created likewiſe at <hi>Avignon,</hi> who thought good to transfer the Apoſtolical Chair from <hi>Avignon</hi> back again to <hi>Rome,</hi> a thing almoſt incredible: for ſo many <hi>French</hi> Popes ſucceeding one another, they had ſo weakned the <hi>Italian</hi> party, that there were ſcarce any <hi>Italian</hi> Cardinals among them all, and of the <hi>French</hi> there were more than twenty.</p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:95405:84"/>
               <p>Several reaſons are alledged to have moved <hi>Gregory</hi> to this reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but particularly theſe following. The firſt was, that he ſaw all <hi>Italy</hi> in Arms, not only by the Wars betwixt <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Genoa,</hi> but by a reſolution ſeveral Cities had taken to ſhake off the yoke of their ſervitude, and re-eſtabliſh themſelves in a ſtate of Liberty, which he believing to be occaſioned by the abſence of the pilot from the Veſſel of <hi>Rome,</hi> he began to think of reſettling his pontifical reſidence in <hi>Italy.</hi> The ſecond was, That one day reprehending a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Biſhop (his familiar) that he left the Biſhoprick to follow the Court, the Biſhop confidently replyed. <hi>And you who are Pope of</hi> Rome, <hi>why are you in</hi> France?<note place="margin">Hiſt. of Cardin. part. 3. lib. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Why are you ſo long from the place where your Church doth lye?</hi> Others will have it, that a Letter from St. <hi>Bridget,</hi> (whom the Pope lookt upon as a true Saint) contributed much, in which ſhe adviſed him as from God, to return to <hi>Rome.</hi> He gave order for twenty Galleys to be ready in the <hi>Rhone,</hi> pretending to go ſomewhither elſe with them, becauſe he ſuſpected, that the <hi>French</hi> (who had ſo much advantage by the reſidence of his Court in <hi>France</hi>) would obſtruct it, if they had the leaſt notice of his removing the See to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But indeed they took not the leaſt Alarum at all the preparations which were made, as not imagining, that a <hi>French</hi> Pope would put ſuch an affront upon his Nation. So that they had no notice of it till the Pope was at Sea, being paſſed as far as <hi>Genoa,</hi> and from <hi>Genoa</hi> to <hi>Cornetto,</hi> where, being weary of his Galleys, he made the reſt of his Voyage by Land: and being arrived at <hi>Rome,</hi> he began to apply fit Medicines and ſpecifical to the maladies of <hi>Italy.</hi> But he dyed <hi>Anno,</hi> 1280. of a great diſtemper in his Bladder, after he had ſate ſix years in <hi>France,</hi> and five in <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is reported, that at the hour of this Pope's Death, the palace of the Pope at <hi>Avignon</hi> was ſet on fire, and could not be quenched,<note place="margin">Bale's Pageant of Pope's.</note> till the greateſt part thereof was burnt. Afterwards enſued the greateſt ſchiſm and diviſion that ever hapned in the Popedom.</p>
               <p>King <hi>John</hi> dyed, <hi>Anno</hi> 1364. to whom ſucceeded his Son <hi>Charles,</hi> the fifth of that name. King <hi>John</hi> dyed in <hi>England:</hi> for the <hi>French</hi> King had an earneſt deſire to ſee the King of <hi>England</hi> again, becauſe he had ſo honourably entertained him whilſt he was his priſoner. So he went, and was entertained very Royally. But ſhortly after, he fell ſick, and dyed at <hi>London.</hi> His Body was conveyed over into <hi>France,</hi> and buried in the Town of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> the King of <hi>Cyprus</hi> being preſent at his Funerals.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> V. called the Wiſe, was crowned at <hi>Rhemes,</hi> together with his Wife, the Daughter of <hi>Peter</hi> Duke of <hi>Bourbon.</hi> He made his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Brother <hi>Philip,</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> who had been priſoner with his Father in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many Lords in <hi>Gaſcoign</hi> revolted from Prince <hi>Edward</hi>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:95405:85"/> unto the <hi>French</hi> King. Prince <hi>Edward</hi> after his great victories, had carried himſelf roughly toward the Noble-men his Subjects. But the <hi>French</hi> King beſides his excellent Wiſdom, was alſo gentle and courteous, inſinuating himſelf into the affections of all men.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> marching with his forces from <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> eaſily recovered all the Towns and holds that were pertaining to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in thoſe quarters. The King of <hi>England</hi> loſt all his whole Seigno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Gaſcoign,</hi> the people partly rebelling; and partly yielding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves willingly to his enemy. <hi>Poictiers</hi> alſo yieldeth to the <hi>French.</hi> The men of <hi>Rochel</hi> yield alſo unto the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> dyed of poiſon taken long before. He was a Prince ſo wiſe and politick,<note place="margin">Froſſard's chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic. in Charl. V. Anno 1380.</note> that fitting in his Gown at <hi>Paris</hi> in eaſe and quietneſs, he recovered many things by counſel and policy, which his predeceſſours had loſt in the field to their Enemies. And among other vexations which hapned to King <hi>Edward</hi> at his laſt Voyage that he intended into <hi>Britain</hi> for the reſcue of his men beſieged, when he was forced back by the extremity of Weather: this one thing trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him above the reſt, that he muſt make war with ſuch an enemy as never bare Arms; nor came into the field; it is reported that he ſaid, he never dealt with any enemy, which uſed ſo little armour, and put him to ſo much trouble. For King <hi>Charles,</hi> after he came to the Crown, never put on Armour himſelf, but managing all his affairs by Wiſdom and policy, committed the execution thereof to his Brothers.</p>
               <p>In the time of <hi>Charles</hi> V. a Book was written in <hi>France,</hi> called, <hi>The Vergers Dream,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Review of the Counc. of Trent. lib. 6. ca. 6.</note> firſt in <hi>Latin,</hi> then tranſlated in <hi>French</hi> by his command. In the ſeventh and eighth Chapter whereof the Clergy-man and the Knight confer together on this wiſe. <hi>I call</hi> (ſaith the Clerk) <hi>and account the Decrees and Decretals of the Holy Fathers of</hi> Rome <hi>to be good Law, which oblige every true Chriſtian as a Subject and Son of a Holy Church our Mother.</hi> To whom the Knight replyeth, <hi>If the terms of</hi> Rome <hi>be Decrees, or Decretals, Ordinals, or Conſtitutions touching the Temporal affairs of Kings, Princes, or other Secular Lords, you Clerks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong your ſelves ſhall call and account them Law, if you pleaſe.</hi> But the truth is, That no Man can eſtabliſh, or ordain any thing where he hath no power nor Authority. So as the King of <hi>France</hi> hath no power to make a Law or Ordinance to bind or tye the Empire; ſo neither can the Laws of the Emperour bind the King of <hi>France</hi> and his Subjects. And a little after. <hi>I hold it therefore a frivolous thing, and very ridiculous, that the Holy Father ſhould make any Decree, Decretal, or conſtitution about Temporal matters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the thirteenth years of the aforeſaid <hi>Charles</hi> V. <hi>Charles</hi> IV. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Germany</hi> came into <hi>France</hi> by <hi>Cambray,</hi> to do certain pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages at St. <hi>Denis,</hi> and elſewhere, and ſo was conveyed with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:95405:85"/> men unto St. <hi>Quintin,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mathias,</hi> a <hi>Bohemian,</hi> abode a long time in <hi>Paris,</hi> and was called <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienſis,</hi> he wrote a large Treatiſe of Antichriſt, in which he proveth that the Pope is the Antichriſt. He inveigheth againſt the Clergy for neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in their callings, and calleth them the Locuſts mentioned in the <hi>Revelation.</hi> He complains that every City, and almoſt each man had his proper Saint or Saviour, beſides Chriſt: the Images and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques that are ſet up in Churches to be adored, he calleth the Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Antichriſt. He ſaith, the worſhip of God is not tyed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, places, nor times; he rebuketh the Cloyſterers for contemning the Lay-men, and calling themſelves the only Religious; he refuteth the merit of works, and calleth them the cauſe of ſalvation, <hi>ſine quâ non.</hi> In the end he propheſied,<note place="margin">Catal. Teſt. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</note> That God will once again ſend Godly prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, who in the zeal of <hi>Elias,</hi> will openly diſcloſe Antichriſt unto the eyes of all the world.</p>
               <p>After the death of Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> the Church began to be miſerably torn with new ſchiſmes, which began to ariſe betwixt the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Cardinals, each Nation chooſing it's own Pope, and in it's own manner. The <hi>French</hi> not able to digeſt the affront they received from <hi>Gregory,</hi> in tranſporting the See from <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> departing pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately from <hi>Rome,</hi> they removed to <hi>Fondi;</hi> and being arrived there, they uſed many invectives and Satyrs againſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VI. whom they had already with the <hi>Italian</hi> Cardinals elected in <hi>Rome.</hi> They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that they were forced to it by the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> otherwiſe it was never their intention to make an <hi>Italian</hi> Pope.</p>
               <p>For theſe reaſons, the Chair (in their Judgements) being vacant, by the favour of <hi>Joan</hi> Queen of <hi>Sicily,</hi> who was their friend,<note place="margin">Il. Cardinaliſmo part 3. lib. 1.</note> they choſe another Pope, one <hi>Roberto,</hi> a Cardinal, with the Title of the Holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. He was of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and particularly of the Antient Family of the <hi>Conti:</hi> in that City he took upon him the name of <hi>Clement</hi> VII. From <hi>Fondi, Clement</hi> removed with his Cardinals to <hi>Avignon,</hi> where he was obeyed by the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniard.</hi> Theſe diſputes laſted long; the Legitimate Pope at <hi>Rome,</hi> and and the Anti-Pope at <hi>Avignon,</hi> firing their Bulls upon one another, and ſending them forth into all parts of the World. The adherents of both ſides ſet forth ſeveral defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Libels, calling one another <hi>Schiſmatick, Heretick, Tyrant, Thief, Traytor, Wicked, Sower of Sedition, Son of Belial,</hi> and ſuch like Stuff: of which there are two Treatiſes extant at this day; one of them written by Dr. <hi>John de Ligni,</hi> in favour of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> againſt <hi>Clement,</hi> and the other by the Abbot of St. <hi>Vaſt</hi> in favour of <hi>Clement</hi> againſt <hi>

               </p>
               <p>Whilſt <hi>Clement</hi> was contriving which way to remove the Pope who reſided in <hi>Rome,</hi> he dyed, <hi>Anno</hi> 1392. and was buried in <hi>Avignon.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:95405:86"/>
               <p>He being dead <hi>Boniface</hi> IX. who was Pope at that time in <hi>Rome;</hi> writ a Fatherly Letter to the <hi>French</hi> Cardinals exhorting them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt from their Schiſm, and return to their obedience to the Holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church, of which he was (he ſaid) the lawful Head. But the <hi>French</hi> laughing (as it were) at ſuch perſwaſions, choſe a ſucceſſour to <hi>Clement,</hi> which was <hi>Pietro della Luna,</hi> who took the name of <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict</hi> XIII. who had argued very much in <hi>Clement</hi>'s juſtification; and that was the principal point upon which he was choſen by the Cardinals, who concluded, that he who defended another's cauſe with ſuch ardour, would doubtleſs more vehemently defend his own.</p>
               <p>Whilſt this Anti-Pope had his reſidence in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> in the Caſtle of <hi>Paniſcola,</hi> adminiſtring the Sacramentss, and conferring of digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. He was condemned together with the Cardinals which elected him by the Authority of a general Council.</p>
               <p>Afterwards he aſſembled a Council at <hi>Perpignan,</hi> where he created ſeveral Cardinals, and commanded them after his death to follow his orders, which were to chooſe another Pope without loſing of time, which they did. For this Anti-Pope being dead at <hi>Paniſcola,</hi> the Cardinals choſe one <hi>Giles Mungot,</hi> a Chanon of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> in his place, calling him <hi>Clement</hi> IX. who at the Inſtance of King <hi>Alphonſo</hi> created Cardinals forthwith, and began to Act in every thing as the true Popes uſe to do.</p>
               <p>But afterwards upon Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the fifth's accomodation with King <hi>Alphonſo, Giles</hi> (being commanded) renounced the rights of the Papacy, and was declared Biſhop of <hi>Majorca:</hi> and the Cardinals which he had created, were likewiſe forced to renounce their Cardinalitial dignity.</p>

                  <hi>CHarles</hi> VI. having called a Council at <hi>Paris</hi> to conſult about the ſchiſm which then was in the Popedom,<note place="margin">Jacob. Mejer. in annalib. rerum.

               <p>In a Decree made <hi>February</hi> 18. 1406. we find a complaint by <hi>Charles</hi> VI. <hi>They take occaſion to reſerve the Firſt-fruits in the vacancies, and to extort great ſums of Money, whereby the Kingdom is exhauſted; and to thruſt themſelves upon the Popedom, for to enrich both them and theirs. And when there is any queſtion</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of preferring men to elective dignities, they never uſed thoſe ways which ought to be obſerved, and which are appointed to examine and try them. Whence it comes to paſs, that it being not poſſible that the Pope ſhould know all Men, and the ſtate of the Churches, he admits divers into thoſe dignities who are unworthy of them, and ſometimes ſuch as are unknown to him but by their money.</hi> He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>They inſert divers clauſes in their Bulls, which are ſometimes inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricable: they make divers Rules beſides the Law, or elſe quite againſt Law, which they revoke at their pleaſure; inſomuch that the moſt clear-ſighted cannot diſcern who hath beſt right among divers pretenders. Hence ariſe infinite Suits in Law, which they muſt proſecute out of the Kingdom with great expence and charges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In another Decree, made the ſame year, he accounts this among other extortions, <hi>Impoſing Tenths, and other Subſidies at their pleaſure, without ever conſulting the reſt of the Biſhops about it, in the raiſing whereof there is no mean obſerved either of Juſtice or equity:</hi> It was then ordained, that none ſhould pay Tythes to Popes nor Cardinals.</p>
               <p>And in another Decree made in <hi>March, Anno</hi> 1408. mention is made of certain preſidents by <hi>Charles</hi> VI. eſtabliſhed at a Council at <hi>Paris.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Not long ago</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it was propoſed and demanded by our Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-General at a Council holden at</hi> Paris, <hi>conſiſting of the Biſhops and Clergy, of the Churches within our Kingdom, and Daulphiny, where our Couſin</hi> Lewes, <hi>King of</hi> Sicily; <hi>our eldeſt Son Duke of</hi> Aquitain <hi>and</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennois; <hi>the Duke of</hi> Bourges <hi>our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nckle by the Father's ſide; the Duke of</hi> Burgundy <hi>our Couſin, and the Duke of</hi> Burbon <hi>our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nckle by the

               </p>
               <p>We read of another Decree made afterwards, wherein complaint is made by the ſame King <hi>Charles</hi> VI. <hi>That an infinite deal of Gold and Silver, and Rents were tranſported out of the Kingdom and the Province of Daulphinè, to the prejudice of the antient Cuſtoms, and the undoing of the Realm; to the irreparable loſs and damage of the Common-wealth, and the miſerable deſolation of the Churches, as well ſuch as were of Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Foundation as others.</hi> And elſewhere he complaineth, <hi>That certain Collectors, and other the Pope of</hi> Rome<hi>'s Officers particularly for his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys have of late oppreſſed the Church and Church-men of our Realm and Province of Daulphinè, by an inſufferable ſlavery, in ſeizing upon the Goods of the Biſhops and Clergy-men, both Regulars and Seculars, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon their Deceaſe;</hi> An Edict was made diſcharging the payment of Annates.</p>

He rather thought on a means whereby he might relieve the Church, by removing out of her all matter of diſſention. Having therefore ſent his Ambaſſadours to the Emperour, as alſo to the Kings of</hi> England, Bohemia, <hi>and</hi> Hungary, <hi>he conjured them not to be wanting to the publick good and tranquillity.</hi> He perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> the Emperour to come to <hi>Rhemes,</hi> where a general Council was held on that occaſion.</p>
               <p>I find another Ordinance of the ſame King <hi>Charles</hi> VI. made by the counſel and aſſiſtance of the Lords and Clergy of <hi>France,</hi>

That the ſacred Canons will have recourſe to be made unto Princes, when ſuch things are committed by great men in the Church, and that according to the opinion of Holy Doctours the Pope ought not to be obeyed in ſuch things wherein the ſtate of the Church is notoriouſly diſturbed.</hi> And in another Ordinance of <hi>April</hi> 17. 1410. <hi>Theſe things being conſidered that it belongs unto us who are the Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,

               </p>
               <p>There is an Arreſt of the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> toward the latter end of this King's Reign, wherein it is ſaid, that Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> and his Officers ſhould from thenceforth give over and abſtain from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action of Annates in the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> and the County of <hi>Daulphinè.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame <hi>Charles</hi> VI. being excommunicated by <hi>Benedict</hi> the XIII. put the bearers of his Bulls to the<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>Honourable Amends,</hi> making them to be carried in Tumbrels, apparelled in painted Coats, with paper Mitres upon their heads, and the Pope's Bull repreſented in their hands, and his Arms reverſed. All which was done by the advice of his Princes, Lords, and the Prelates and other Eccleſiaſticks of his Kingdom, together with the Parliament and Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> as appeareth by the Acts publiſhed concerning this particular.</p>
               <p>After the death of Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> IX. the Cardinals created <hi>Coſmo di Sulmona</hi> Pope, who took the name of <hi>Innocent</hi> VII. he lived but two years after, and dyed in a time when all <hi>Italy</hi> was in an ill condition.</p>
               <p>Whilſt this ſchiſm continued, Three Princes in <hi>France</hi> (who by reaſon of the King's indiſpoſition did then govern that Kingdom) <hi>viz.</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Berry,</hi> of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and of <hi>Orleans,</hi> went all of them together to <hi>Pietro di Luna</hi> (who was called <hi>Benedict</hi> XIII.) to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vignon,</hi> beſeeching him to provide againſt this diſorder, by renouncing the Papacy; urging, that it was much better to have the publick inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt take place than the private; and the rather becauſe he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in his Election to lay down, whenſoever things ſhould be adjuſted with <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They alſo promiſed him, That <hi>that</hi> Pope, which ſhould be made in <hi>Rome</hi> after <hi>Innocent</hi> ſhould do the like, every one believing, that if theſe two favourites (one of <hi>France,</hi> the other of <hi>Italy</hi>) were diſpoſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the power of the Keys, which they both exerciſed at that time, a third ought to be created, who ſhould be the certain and undoubted Pope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Benedict</hi> replyed, that he could not without offending God, conſent to the counſels propoſed for his renouncing the Church, and abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the flock of Chriſt, which by the common conſent of ſo many good and worthy perſons and Electors, was committed to his cuſtody, being unwilling to bring a thing in queſtion which he had ſo legally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. And for what reſpected the taking away the ſchiſm, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring concord to the Church, it pleaſed him very well, and he would condeſcend to it with all his heart, provided a ſecure place were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:95405:88"/> in which every one might ſpeak his mind freely. For his own part he ſwore, that in caſe the ſchiſm could not be taken away by any other means, that he would renounce the Papacy upon condition the other at <hi>Rome</hi> would do the ſame; otherwiſe it was to no purpoſe to ſolicite it.</p>
               <p>The Princes underſtood <hi>Benedict</hi>'s mind, and how little he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to an accomodation, and among themſelves conſulted of ſome way to bring him over to their deſires. <hi>Benedict</hi> fearing ſome violence, fortified himſelf in his palace, and was beſieged there the ſpace of five or ſix months.</p>
               <p>But being weary of ſo long and cloſe a confinement, he imbarked in the <hi>Rhone</hi> upon certain Galleys (which he had cauſed to be put in order for ſuch an enterprize, whilſt he was beſieged in his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace) and in them he eſcaped into <hi>Catalonia,</hi> which was his own Countrey.</p>
               <p>Some ſay, that theſe three Princes diſcourſed in this manner with <hi>Benedict</hi> at the importunity of the <hi>French</hi> Cardinals, who hated the ſaid <hi>Benedict,</hi> becauſe he was a <hi>Catalonian,</hi> not a <hi>French-man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Italian</hi> Cardinals, and the Cardinals of other Nations which were preſent in <hi>Rome,</hi> after the death of <hi>Innocent,</hi> being entred into the conclave, in a place near St. <hi>Peters,</hi> they ſwore all of them ſolemnly upon the Holy Evangeliſts, which their Dean held in his hand, that they would every one renounce the Papacy if they were choſen, ſo that the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Catalonian</hi> Anti-Pope renounced his Anti-Papacy firſt.</p>
               <p>The cauſe of this Reſolution was to ſatisfie the <hi>French,</hi> who having introduced the cuſtom of creating of Popes according to their own mode, it ſeemed impoſſible to turn them out of that way with reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unleſs the <hi>Italians</hi> reſolved to do the ſame; and the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Benedict</hi> declared, it would be in vain to think of a remedy for the ſcandal of the Church, without a renunciation of both the Popes; whereas if they renounced, another would be choſen out of the whole College of Cardinals, that would be true and undoubted Pope, whom the Princes and people would readily obey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Angelo Corraro,</hi> a <hi>Venetian,</hi> was choſen in <hi>Rome;</hi> he was Cardinal of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and aſſumed the Name of <hi>Gregory</hi> XII. Before he came out of the conclave, they made him promiſe under the hand of the Notary in writing, to obſerve what he had promiſed and ſubſcribed with his own hand; and at laſt gave him an Oath. But the place where theſe two Popes were to meet being in diſpute, and they not like to come to an agreement; both <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Benedict</hi> alledging a thouſand difficulties, the <hi>French</hi> Cardinals reſolved to abandon <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,</hi> and the <hi>Italians Gregory,</hi> and to declare them breakers of their Faith.</p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:95405:88"/>
               <p>The Cardinals both of <hi>Avignon</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> being met at <hi>Piſa,</hi> did by common conſent deprive <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Benedict,</hi> all the reſt of the Nations concurring with them, except <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and the hither part of <hi>Spain,</hi> the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and the Count of <hi>Armignac,</hi> who were favourers of <hi>Benedict.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in deſpight of their contradictions, they choſe <hi>Pietro Filardo,</hi> a Fryar Minor, and Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Milan,</hi> who took upon him the name of <hi>Alexander</hi> V. a name ſuitable to his Actions, for which reaſon it was pleaſantly ſaid by himſelf, that he was a <hi>rich Biſhop, a poor Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, and a beggarly Pope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gregory</hi> hearing that <hi>Alexander</hi> was created Pope, and underſtanding what ſentence the Cardinals had paſſed againſt him and <hi>Benedict,</hi> fled towards <hi>Romagna,</hi> urging and inſiſting (whereſoever he came) upon a general Council. He ſtayed at <hi>Rimini</hi> for a time, where he was mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificently entertained by <hi>Carlo Malateſte.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Benedict</hi> having held a Council in the City of <hi>Perpignan,</hi> by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention of his own friends, retireth again for his greater ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity into his Caſtle of <hi>Paniſcola,</hi> where he had been long before.</p>
               <p>But though theſe two Anti-Popes had been deprived by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Piſa,</hi> yet they deſiſted not from their Papal, and Eccleſiaſtical functions.</p>
               <p>They created Cardinals, and particularly <hi>Gabriel Condolmero</hi> was created Cardinal, who was afterwards <hi>Eugenius</hi> IV.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> lived not above eight months Pope, he dyed in <hi>Bologna.</hi> Then the Cardinals choſe <hi>Baltaſar Coſſa</hi> (a <hi>Neopolitan</hi>) Pope, who would be called <hi>John</hi> XXIII.</p>
               <p>Chriſtendom being weary to ſee ſo many ſchiſms on foot, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving which way to put an end to it. Therefore by the orders of all Nations, <hi>John</hi> was cited to appear at a general Council.</p>
               <p>He ſent two Cardinals immediately to negotiate with the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> and of <hi>France,</hi> about the choice of a fit place for the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Council. At length <hi>Conſtance</hi> was pitcht upon as the moſt convenient City of all. At the time appointed, they met, and <hi>John</hi> among the reſt, who carried along with him certain men very Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with whom he held the <hi>Germans</hi> for a long time in variety of diſputes.</p>
               <p>But the Emperour <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> arriving at the ſame time many great delinquencies were objected againſt <hi>John,</hi> who being conſcious of their truth, and fearing corporal puniſhment, as well as to be deprived of the Papacy, fled out of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> in the diſguiſe of a Foot-man, and retired to <hi>Shaffuſen,</hi> a City belonging to <hi>Frederick</hi> Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> whither divers Cardinals of his creation fled alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi> being recited by the Council, fled to <hi>Friburg,</hi> to be under the protection of the Duke of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> But he was taken, and by order
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:95405:89"/> of the Council impriſoned in the Iſle of St. <hi>Mark</hi> near <hi>Conſtance.</hi> Above fourty Articles were proved againſt him; and all the Fathers concurring in the ſentence, <hi>John</hi> was legally depoſed, and the ſentence ſent to him to ſubſcribe, which he willingly did.</p>
               <p>Then was he delivered unto <hi>Ludovico Bavaro,</hi> to be kept in ſafe cuſtody. Three years he continued a priſoner in the caſtle of <hi>Haldel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg.</hi> In this Council a Decree was publiſhed, that a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil lawfully aſſembled was above the Pope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gregory</hi> came not to the Council, but ſent by <hi>Carlo Malateſta</hi> to the Council to let them underſtand his willingneſs to renounce. <hi>Gregory</hi> was hereupon declared Legate <hi>Della Marca,</hi> and went to his charge, but he dyed ſoon after at <hi>Ricanati</hi> of diſcontent. <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> being removed, there remained a third ſtill, which was <hi>Benedict</hi> XIII. who declared that he would never renounce. Hereupon <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> the Emperour went in perſon to the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and of <hi>England,</hi> to adviſe with them about forcing <hi>Benedict</hi> to a renouncing alſo: <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmund</hi> having received a ſatisfactory anſwer from theſe two Princes, he went to <hi>Narbon,</hi> and diſcourſed perſonally with <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> whoſe Subjects paid obedience to <hi>Benedict.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Benedict</hi> ſtill alledged, that he was the true Vicar of Chriſt, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that <hi>Conſtance</hi> was not a place convenient for the liberty of an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Council, ſeeing that <hi>John</hi> had been condemned and depoſed from the Papacy, by thoſe very perſons who had been formerly his Friends, and received him to the Pontifical dignity.</p>
               <p>The Princes of <hi>Spain</hi> obſerving the pertinacity of <hi>Benedict,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred with the opinion of the Council, which was managed by five ſeveral Nations, <hi>viz. Italy, Germany, England, France,</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> What theſe Nations had done was approved, and publiſhed by a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, or a publick Notary. Then <hi>Benedict</hi>'s cauſe being diſcuſſed, he was at laſt depoſed, and declared void of the Papacy, no reckoning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made of the abſent <hi>Scots,</hi> and Count <hi>d'Armignac,</hi> who continued their obedience to him. About this time <hi>John Huſs,</hi> and <hi>Jerome</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> his Diſciple, were condemned and burnt for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Novemb.</hi> 8. <hi>Anno</hi> 1417. thirty two Cardinals entred the conclave, with thirty others for the ſeveral Nations, which is ſix a piece, and on the 11<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of the ſame Month, which was the Feaſt of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> about three in the Morning, Cardinal <hi>di ſan Gregorio</hi> (called <hi>Oddo Colonna</hi> before) was created Pope, with great ſatisfaction to the people. The Emperour preſently went into the conclave, and having thanked the Cardinals kiſſed the Pope's Feet. The Pope embraced him, and thanked him for his great induſtry in that affair. This Pope would needs be called <hi>Martin,</hi> becauſe his Election hapned on that Saint's day. Then all the <hi>French</hi> Cardinals left <hi>Benedict,</hi> and came in unto <hi>Martin;</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:95405:89"/> the <hi>Scots,</hi> and <hi>d'Armignac</hi> did the ſame, and all Chriſtendom except <hi>Paniſcola</hi> which remained divided.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Martin</hi> being deſirous to put an end to the Council, <hi>Anno</hi> 1418. he made a publick Aſſembly; after which by common conſent, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of <hi>Sigiſmund, Ibaldo</hi> Cardinal of St. <hi>Vito,</hi> by order from the Pope, pronounced theſe words of diſmiſſion, <hi>Domini ite in pace,</hi> and ſo all had liberty to depart.</p>

               <p>When <hi>Benedict</hi> had ſate thirty years, and was dead, his Cardinals choſe Pope <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. but he compounded with <hi>Martin,</hi> and ſo the ſchiſm was ended.</p>

                  <hi>France</hi> was now ſtrangely divided into divers factions. The King's Authority were for the Queen and the <hi>Burgundian.

               <p>At length a peace is made betwixt the <hi>Daulphin</hi> and the <hi>Burgundian, Anno</hi> 1419. but ſoon after the <hi>Daulphin</hi> cauſeth <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi> to be murthered in his preſence.

               </p>

                  <hi>Charles</hi> VII. after the deceaſe of his Father <hi>Charles</hi> VI. took upon him the name of King of <hi>France,</hi> notwithſtanding the pretenſion of the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> He was 21 years old when he began to reign, and reigned 39 years.

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:95405:90"/> things as ought to be reformed in the Church, and among others, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions this, <hi>That known Men, and ſuch as are moſt fitting, be Elected out of the ſame Countrey: that ſtrangers in manners, language, and educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be not ſent and ſet over Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in his Book of Eccleſiaſtical power,<note place="margin">Gerſon lib. de Eccleſ. poteſt.</note> after he hath ſpoken of the divers abuſes of the Popes, he addeth, <hi>What ſhall we think is to be ſaid of an infinite number of ſuch like things that are done, caſting aſide all care and regard of all Spiritual and Divine matters, which concern the Chriſtian Faith and Religion? What think you? What ſhall we ſay for the preſent of that ſo eaſie a diſpenſation as they ſpeak of, granted by the Pope and the Prelates over lawful Oaths, reaſonable Vows, for the exceſſive plurality of Benefices, the general</hi> non obſtantes <hi>of Councils, the privileges and exemptions againſt common right? Who can number all the ways whereby the force of Eccleſiaſtical (yea of Evangelical) Diſcipline is enfeebled, conſumed, and quite annihilated?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He addeth the cunning and glozing flattery of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p-ſtarts, whiſpering the Clergy, but eſpecially the Pope in the Ear. Oh how great is the height of your Eccleſiaſtical power! O ſacred Clergy! all ſecular Authority is but a Toy in compariſon of thine, ſeeing that as all power is given to Chriſt, both in Heaven and Earth, ſo Chriſt hath bequeathed all to St.</hi> Peter, <hi>and his Succeſſours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So that</hi> Conſtantine <hi>gave nothing to Pope</hi> Silveſter, <hi>which was not ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally his own; but only reſtored unto him what he unjuſtly detained from him. Again, as there is no power but is of God, ſo there is nothing Temporal or Spiritual, Imperial or Regal, which is not of the Pope, upon whoſe Thigh God hath Writ,</hi> King of Kings, <hi>and</hi> Lord of Lords. <hi>So as to diſpute his power is a kind of Sacrilege.</hi>

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:95405:91"/> ranked above others in greatneſs, and Authority, by ſo much they labour the more to overthrow them, out of a domineering hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour for the enlarging of their primacy and ſupreme power, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the commodities of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is very large, and above any Kingdom (though it hath been ſufficiently cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd by their negligence) can no way ſuffice to maintain the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their State, which they have purpoſed to raiſe high enough above all the Kings and Emperours in the World, have caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into thoſe flocks of others that abound in breeding, in Wool and Milk. He afterwards ſpecifies the looſeneſs, the luxury, vanities, worldlineſs,<note place="margin">Clemang. lib. de lapſu &amp; reparat. juſtit. p. 10.</note> rapines, vexations, uſurpations, oppreſſions, and other ſuch like abuſes and vices of the Popes and their Courts. In another Book of his he ſheweth, that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> hath infected <hi>France,</hi> by coming there, ſpecifying all the vices and blemiſhes that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated unto it, and thoſe not a few.</p>
               <p>There was a time (ſaith he) when the Apoſtolick Biſhop, being vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Tyranny of the <hi>Italians,</hi> made choice of <hi>France</hi> for his ſeat, and for all the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſuppoſing he could not find aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red refuge elſe-where: to whom I could with (ſaith he) the ſtrength of <hi>France</hi> had not proved a Staff of a Reed, as it was a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fore-told that it ſhould. What was it elſe that brought <hi>France</hi> upon the ſudden into theſe miſeries, making her fall away from emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent glory which made her flouriſh above all other Nations, but that degenerating from thoſe Ancient vertues which adorned her with ſuch an excellency of Honour, ſhe is changed from Valour to cowardiſe, from diligence to ſloath, from honeſty to ignominy, from gravity to a wanton lightneſs; from temperance to luxury; from courage to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; from liberality to covetouſneſs, and unreſtrained ſpoiling, from order to confuſion, from zeal of the publick good to private gains, from correction and diſcipline to a general impunity and licenſe of all wickedneſs and miſ-demeanours, and from Juſtice to all iniquity.</p>
               <p>And elſewhere he complaineth thus, <hi>So the Church which Chriſt hath taken for his Spouſe without blemiſh disfigured by this horrible villany,</hi>

                  <hi>is now the ſhop of all Pride, of all Trading, filching and ſtealing; where the Sacraments are hung out for a ſhew, and all the orders, even the Prieſthood it ſelf: where favours are ſold for ſilver, diſpenſations for not preaching, licenſes for non-reſidence: Where all Offices and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, yea even ſins are bought and ſold: Laſtly, where Maſſes, and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Lord's body are ſet to ſale. Would any Man have a Biſhoprick? let him provide his Money, and that no ſmall ſum, but a great one for ſo great a Title: and let him not ſtand upon emptying his purſe, for the purchaſe of ſuch a Dignity, ſeeing he will quickly fill it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and that more ſoundly than he could do by many ſorts of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize.

               </p>
               <p>And in another place ſpeaking of the Popes, he ſaith, <hi>They have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated unto themſelves the right of diſpoſing of all Churches, in all places as far as the Chriſtian Religion reacheth, of all Biſhopricks and Dignities, which are conferred by election, voiding and diſanulling the Decrees for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly made by the Holy Fathers, with ſo much care and commodity, that ſo they may by this means fill their own Budgets the better. And ſince this cuſtom was uſed, there have been none but Dunces, Worldlings, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-men, and ſuch as were raiſed to thoſe Dignities by Simony.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>To the end that the Rivers of Gold derived from all parts, may flow unto them in a fuller ſtream, they have taken away the power of preſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the liberty of beſtowing and diſpoſing of Benefices, by any means whatſoever, from all Dioceſans, and lawful Patrons, forbidding them upon pain of</hi> Anathema, <hi>raſhly to preſume (for ſo their Writs run) to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute any perſon into a Benefice within their juriſdiction, till ſuch time as ſome one be preſented to it, to whom by their Authority they have granted it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And again (ſaith he) <hi>What greedineſs is this</hi> (ſpeaking of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals) <hi>to hold ſuch a number of repugnant and incompatible Benefices? They are Monks and Chanons, Regulars and Seculars. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder the ſame habit they enjoy the Rights, Degrees, Offices, and Benefices of all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of all Orders, of all Profeſſions; not two or three, but ten, twenty, an hundred, two hundred, yea ſometimes five hundred, and upwards: and thoſe no petty ones, nor contemptible, but of the beſt and fatteſt. And how great a number ſoever they have of them, they are never content, but ſtill would have more. They are daily ſuing for new Graces, new Grants. Thus they catch up all the Vacancies, and go away with all.</hi>

                  <hi>Charles</hi> VII. now King of <hi>France,</hi> was ſo diſtreſſed, that he had only two entire Provinces left him, <hi>viz.

The Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Turenne</hi> ſaid alſo at <hi>Baſil,</hi> that three millions of Gold came unto <hi>Rome</hi> in his time, within the ſpace of fourteen years, from the Prelates and prelacies, whereof no account could be made, beſides the poor Clergy, which daily ran to that Court.</p>
               <p>The Emperour <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> required <hi>Peter de Aliaco,</hi> Chancellour of <hi>Paris,</hi> and Cardinal of <hi>Cambray,</hi> to put in form ſome Articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Reformation of the Church, that might be propounded to the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> aforementioned, which he did. In that Book he inſiſteth on four things. 1. He propoundeth, that general and Provincial Councils be kept, eſpecially General, for amending all perſons and eſtates. 2. That for Reformation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court, it is ſufficient that there be but one Cardinal out of every Province, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Cardinals are the cauſes of Schiſms. 3. That Prelates be not choſen young, imprudent, nor ignorant. 4. He requireth the reformation of Monks, ſpeaking againſt their multitude and diverſity, he taxeth the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Court, that they deſpiſe Divines, and advance on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch as can bring them in gain. He complaineth alſo of <hi>Pagan</hi>

That it ſhould be by one Man is againſt all reaſon, how eminent ſoever he be for his virtues, his knowledge, his worth, although be he renowned for his miracles, nay in my opinion not by the Pope himſelf alone. For there are ſo many Canons, Decretals and Conſtitutions made by them already, as are good for nought but filling up Parchment to no purpoſe, without working any Reformation.</hi> Beſides, <hi>ſeeing it is evident, that his own Court ſtands in great need of Reformation, as hath been well known by the common cries of the laſt General Councils; which Court of his if he
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:95405:93"/> either cannot or will not reform, which he covers under his Wing, how is it credible that he ſhould reform the Church, which is of ſo large an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent?</hi> Beſides, it may be objected to him, <hi>Apply the ſalve to your own ſores firſt as being the Head; for when that is cured, you may with leſs difficulty cure the Members; wherefore Phyſician heal thy ſelf. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury ſalt is not good for ſeaſoning. Wherefore (by the juſt judgement of God) his Decrees are ſcarce well received yet, nor ever will be till he have reformed himſelf and his Dependents.

Thoſe who have the Preſidency in Councils on the Pope's behalf, when they ſee that matters in the Council make againſt their Maſters and them, what can be expected from them, but that they will withſtand the Decrees of ſuch Councils with might and main, either by diſſolving them, or ſowing diſſentions in them; and ſo the thing ſhall remain unperfected, and we dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to return to the old Wilderneſs of Errour and Ignorance: Every body knows this to be true, unleſs it be ſome one haply who is not experienced in time paſt. The Tragedy which was acted in our Age at the Council of</hi> Baſil <hi>doth ſufficiently prove it, as they knew well who have laid down the ſtory before our eyes.</hi>

Then <hi>Panormitan</hi> as ſoon as the <hi>Concordat</hi> began to be read, riſing up with his companions and other <hi>Arragons,</hi> cryed out with a loud voice, ſaying: <hi>You Fathers do contemn our Requeſts, you contemn Kings and Princes and deſpiſe Prelates. It is not for you to conclude: We are the major part of the Prelates, we make the Council, and it is our part to conclude, And I in the Name of all other Prelates do conclude that is to be deferred.</hi> Then there was ſuch a rumour in the Council, as is wont to be in Battles with the ſound of Trumpets, and noiſe of Horſemen, When two Armies joyn; ſome curſing that which <hi>Panormitan</hi> went about, others allowing the ſame.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Nicholas Amici,</hi> a Divine of <hi>Paris,</hi> ſaid; <hi>Panormitan,</hi> I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:95405:94"/> from this your concluſion to the judgement of the Council here preſent; neither do I affirm any thing to be ratified which you have done, as I am ready to prove, if it ſhall ſeem good.

But neither the Fathers of the Council were determined to depart without a concluſion, neither was <hi>Panormitan</hi> minded to alter his intent and purpoſe.</p>

               <p>The late King <hi>Charles</hi> willing to follow the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> had ſummoned a Parliament at <hi>Bitures,</hi> where by the full conſent of all the States in <hi>France</hi> both Spiritual and Temporal, a certain conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was decreed and publiſhed, called the <hi>Pragmatick Sanction,</hi> wherein was comprehended, briefly the pith of all the Canons and Decrees concluded in the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> of which conſtitution I hinted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The ſame the ſaid King <hi>Charles</hi> commanded to be obſerved
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:95405:94"/> and ratified inviolably throughout all his Realm, for the Honour and increaſe of Chriſtian Religion for ever. Now King <hi>Lewes</hi> XI. ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour to <hi>Charles,</hi> had promiſed before (being <hi>Daulphin</hi>) unto Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the ſecond (called before <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi>) that if ever he came to the Crown, the aforeſaid <hi>Pragmatick Sanction</hi> ſhould be aboliſhed. Pope <hi>Pius</hi> hearing him to be crowned, ſent unto him <hi>John Balveus</hi> a Cardinal with his Letters Patent, willing him to be mindful of his former promiſe. The King hereupon directed the Pope's Letters Patent with the ſaid Cardinal to the Council of <hi>Paris,</hi> requiring them to conſult upon the cauſe.</p>
               <p>The matter being propoſed in the Parliament-houſe, the King's Attorney named <hi>Joannes Romanus,</hi> a learned and eloquent Man, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſaid Sanction to be profitable, good, and neceſſary for the wealth of the Realm, and in no caſe to be aboliſhed. Unto whoſe ſentence the Univerſity of <hi>Paris</hi> adjoyning their conſent,<note place="margin">Du.

And the ſame King <hi>Lewes, Anno</hi> 1463. to ſecure himſelf from the cenſures of the ſaid Pope, with the advice of his Parliament, ordained an Arreſt, that the Cardinal of <hi>Conſtance</hi> ſhould be puniſhed, becauſe he had reſiſted the Rights and Authorities of the King, ſaith Mr. <hi>John du Tillet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Lewes</hi> XI. cauſed a Council of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, and all the Univerſities to be aſſembled in the City of <hi>Orleans,</hi> to be more fully informed in the buſineſs of the <hi>Pragmatick Sanction;</hi> at which, <hi>Peter</hi> Duke of <hi>Burbon,</hi> Lord of <hi>Beaview,</hi> preſided inſtead of the King.</p>
               <p>And the Court of Parliament in thoſe Remonſtrances which they made unto King <hi>Lewes,</hi> among other inconveniences, which they ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged would follow upon the abrogation of the <hi>Pragmatick Sanction,</hi> ſay, By this means Strangers would be preferred by the Pope, and not the Natives of the Countrey, wherein the Benefices lye; not of the ſame qualities and conditions with the Countrey: Whereupon would enſue queſtions and controverſies betwixt the Church-men or Seculars, to the great hinderance of ſalvation of Souls; and irreverence of the bleſſed Sacraments.</p>
               <p>The Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> in the Remonſtrance made by <hi>Lewes</hi> XI. touching the defence of the <hi>Pragmatick Sanction,</hi> hath inſerted this Article; <hi>Item, It belongeth to our Soveraign Lord the King, who is the principal Founder, Guardian, Protector of the Liberties of the</hi> Gallican <hi>Church, when ſhe ſuffers in her Liberties,</hi>

               <p>We find an Ordinance made, (relating to Abbeys, Biſhopricks and Benefices,) by the ſame King, <hi>Anno</hi> 1464. which runs in this ſtrain. <hi>Howbeit that by Priviledges Expreſs, and Ordinances Royal, no Man can have any Elective Benefice within our ſaid Kingdom, and</hi> Daulphinè, <hi>it concerns us much, that the Biſhopricks, Abbeys and other Dignities, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective benefices, be furniſhed with able and known Men, ſuch as will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with us, and be firm and ſure for us, eſpecially ſuch as hold the ſaid Benefices, and by reaſon of them divers places and Fortreſſes, for which divers duties and ſervices belong unto us from them: Yet notwithſtanding our late pious Father granted the ſaid favour and Patents ſo plentifully, and to all manner of Perſons of what Nation, Kingdom, or Religion ſoever they were, without diſtinction; that many under ſhadow and pretence of theſe Licences and Patents, have inſinuated and intruded themſelves into the ſaid Dignities, and elective Benefices of our ſaid Kingdom, and do hold them; Howbeit many of them are Strangers unknown, and not to be truſted by us; and ſuch as neither can nor ought to perform thoſe Duties and Services, which they are bound to do unto us by reaſon of the ſaid Benefices.</hi>

               <p>After the death of Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> V. which happned in the year, 1455. tne Cardinals entring into the conclave made four factions, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven of them pretending to the Papacy themſelves, and yet there were but XV. for any one. After this there began ſtrong practices in the behalf of Cardinal <hi>Beſſarion,</hi> a <hi>Grecian,</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the <hi>Latin</hi> Church. He had diſputed much againſt purgatory unleavened bread, and againſt the very perſon of the Holy Ghoſt, who (he aſſerted) proceeded from the Father alone, and not from the Father and Son.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Bettone,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Avignon,</hi> laboured to fruſtrate that enterprize, who thus expreſſed himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſt Illuſtrious Lords, ſhall we prefer a</hi> Grecian <hi>to the</hi> Latin <hi>Church, and eſtabliſh a</hi> Neophite <hi>in the higheſt place of the</hi> Vatican?<note place="margin">11 Cardinaliſmo. part. 3. lib. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Who can aſſure us his converſion is true? Heterodox opinions in matter of Religion, though renounced and altered with the Tongue, do yet leave a muddineſs and diſturbance upon the heart. Shall we give the Keys of Heaven to him, who for ſo many years, and with ſo many Arguments denyed that there was a purgatory? Shall we make him Head of the Catholick Church who oppoſed it with ſo much boldneſs? Is the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>ſo poor
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:95405:95"/> and indigent, that there cannot be one perſon found out who was born in her boſom, and is worthy of the Government of the flock of Chriſt? What will the reſt of the Nations ſay, to ſee us go up and down begging our Popes of this Countrey, and of that? Rouze up your ſelves moſt noble Companions, and permit not a thing ſo ſcandalous in the Church of Chriſt. I am ſure of this, He which is a Friend to Chriſtianity, will not give his voice for ſuch a Pope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe words being ſpoken with great energy, had ſuch an effect upon the Cardinals, that they choſe Cardinal <hi>Alphonſo Borgia,</hi> of the City of <hi>Valenza</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> who took the name of <hi>Calixtus</hi> III.</p>
               <p>He lived three years, and dyed <hi>Auguſt</hi> 6. 1458. and on the 20<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of the ſame Month, Cardinal <hi>Aeneas Piccolomini</hi> of <hi>Siena,</hi> was created Pope by 18. Cardinals which were preſent in the conclave, in which there were but two competitors for the Papacy, <hi>viz.</hi> Cardinal <hi>Rotoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſis</hi> and <hi>Aeneas</hi> aforeſaid: ſo that for the four days time in which it was debated in the conclave, they had no other difficulty but to make choice of the one or the other of theſe two.</p>
               <p>It was ſtrange to ſee each of theſe two perſons driving on his own promotion, magnifying his own virtues, and debaſing the qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Adverſary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rotomagenſis</hi> in this manner went from one Cardinal to another, ſaying, What have ye to do with <hi>Aeneas?</hi> How can ye think him wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the Papacy? What paſſion blinds you, ſo as to confer an office of that import upon a gouty Beggar? Where is his Knowledge? Where is his Learning? Will ye make him a Pope becauſe he is a Poet? It is not long ſince he came out of <hi>Germany;</hi> and may he not be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to transfer the See into <hi>Germany?</hi> I ſhould not have ambition'd it, had I not ſeen a perſon ſtand for it of much weaker parts than my ſelf. Beſides, I am the Ancienter Cardinal of the two. And I believe you think I have parts and Learning enough to govern the Church of Chriſt. Moreover, I am of Royal extraction, and have wealth, friends, and faculties wherewithall to accommodate and alleviate the neceſſities of the Church: and upon my Election, the many Benefices I hold will be divided among you.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Avignon</hi> purſued the intereſt of <hi>William Rotoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſis,</hi> not ſo much as he was a <hi>French-man,</hi> as becauſe upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion the Church of the ſaid <hi>William,</hi> he hoped, with his Palace and Chancery would fall to him. He aſſembled therefore certain Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals in an houſe of Office, as in a ſecret place in the night, and agreed with them about the way how <hi>William</hi> ſhould be choſen. The Cardinal of <hi>Bologna</hi> diſcovered the buſineſs to <hi>Aeneas</hi> after midnight.</p>
               <p>In the morning early <hi>Aeneas</hi> went to Cardinal <hi>Roderigo,</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and one of the conſpirators for <hi>Rotomagenſis,</hi> who had received a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:95405:96"/> in writing from the ſaid <hi>William,</hi> and the Cardinal of <hi>Avignon,</hi> that the Chancellourſhip ſhould not be taken from him.</p>
               <p>He excuſed himſelf to <hi>Aeneas</hi> that he had concurred, becauſe he certainly believed he would be choſen, and he was unwilling to hang off, and loſe his Chancellours place. <hi>Aeneas</hi> anſwered, will you then ſell your Vote, and by Simony run your ſelf into the diſpleaſure of God? Do you take ſo little care then to obtrude a youth upon the <hi>Vatican,</hi> and one that is an enemy to your Nation? Know that the Chancellourſhip which is promiſed to you, is promiſed likewiſe, and confirmed to the Cardinal of <hi>Avignon:</hi> and can you think that a <hi>French</hi> Pope will do more for a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> than for one of his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But <hi>Roderigo Borgia</hi> gave him not a word.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Aeneas</hi> departing found out the Cardinal of <hi>Pavia,</hi> who was one of the conſpirators likewiſe, and accoſted him in this manner. I hear you reſolve to chooſe <hi>Rotomagenſis</hi> Pope: you ought to be aſhamed to degenerate ſo much from Cardinal <hi>Brando</hi> your Uncle, who with ſo much labour and ſweat tyred himſelf out, to transfer the Pontifical court from <hi>Germany</hi> to <hi>Rome:</hi> and you that are his Nephew would tranſport it from <hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>France.</hi> Surely <hi>Rotomagenſis</hi> will never give the <hi>Italians</hi> the precedence before the <hi>French,</hi> and yet you an <hi>Italian</hi> will confederate ſooner with <hi>France</hi> than with your own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. Can you have the heart to ſee your ſelf a ſlave to the <hi>French,</hi> when it is in your power to make the <hi>French</hi> obedient to our Nation?</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Pavia</hi> replyed, that he did not believe that the <hi>French</hi> had any thoughts againſt the profit of the Church, they having given with ſo much generoſity moſt of the Provinces it poſſeſſed, and they would not probably take away that which they had ſo lately given. To which <hi>Aeneas</hi> replyed thus.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe that ſhould be, ought it not to ſtir up your heart againſt <hi>Rotomagenſis,</hi> to conſider the infamy of his manners, who is given to all laſciviouſneſs. You have often told me, you would ſooner dye, than give your voice for <hi>Rotomagenſis.</hi> What is the reaſon of ſo great a change? Is he in the twinkling of an eye become an Angel of a Devil? Or are you become a Devil of an Angel?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pavia</hi> was aſtoniſhed at theſe words, and wept, replying, All that you ſay <hi>Aeneas</hi> is true: But I have paſt my word to make <hi>Rotomagenſis</hi> Pope, and if I do not, I ſhall be held infamous, and a Traytor. To which <hi>Aeneas</hi> anſwered. Things ſtand ſo, that which way ſoever you turn you, you cannot avoid the blemiſh of a Traytor: It is in your power whether you will betray <hi>Italy</hi> and your Countrey; or betray him, and be faithful to your Countrey and <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With theſe words <hi>Pavia</hi> was overcome, and reſolves to betray <hi>Rotogamenſis.</hi> Then meeting with Cardinal <hi>Pietro di Santa Maria
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:95405:96"/> nova,</hi> and other <hi>Italian</hi> Cardinals in the Cardinal of <hi>Genoa's</hi> chamber, they all reſolved to prefer <hi>Aeneas</hi> before any body elſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rotomagenſis</hi> fearing things would not happen as he expected, ſeeing <hi>Aeneas</hi> going toward the Schedule, he ſaid to him with an humble voice, <hi>Aeneas, I recommend my ſelf to thee: remember me I beſeech thee, and have compaſſion on me. Aeneas</hi> anſwered him only thus, <hi>Poor Worm, thou miſtakeſt in recommending thy ſelf to me.</hi> The Scruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny being publiſhed, it appeared, that <hi>Aeneas</hi> had three voices more than <hi>Rotomagenſis,</hi> but they could not obtain their two thirds, this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed the <hi>French</hi> Cardinals.</p>
               <p>The Cardinals <hi>Roderigo</hi> and <hi>Santa Anaſtaſia</hi> declared <hi>Aeneas</hi> with a loud voice, which Cardinal <hi>Proſper Colonna</hi> obſerving, being ambitious to have the honour of making the Pope (forasmuch as there wanted but one voice) aroſe, took his way toward <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and though he was reſtrained by Cardinal <hi>Niceno,</hi> and <hi>Rotomagenſis</hi> he cryed aloud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I joyn my ſelf to Cardinal <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and do make him Pope. This being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">

                  </gap>d by the reſt of the Cardinals, they all threw themſelves down at <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s Feet, ſaluted him Pope, and confirmed the election afterwards with the uſual ſuffrages. Then Cardinal <hi>Beſſarion</hi> apologized for himſelf to the new Pope, and for all the reſt of the Cardinals who had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured <hi>Rotomagenſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To whom <hi>Aeneas;</hi> I aſſure you, you ſhall be all equally dear to me; for I acknowledge my Election, not from this perſon, or from that, but from God, and the whole body of the Colledge inſpir'd by the Holy Ghoſt, from whence all perfection cometh.</p>

And by this means all this Kingdom (which is already at a low ebb, and very poor) ſhall be ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and diſpoiled of that little Money which remains of the former Exactions.</p>
               <p>In one Ordinance of this King <hi>Lewes</hi> we find theſe words. <hi>It is a ſtrange thing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the unjuſt exactions of the Court of</hi> Rome <hi>ſhould be ſuffered; ſuch as their expectative Bulls, and other like knacks, their Money for vacancies, which is levied contrary to the holy Canons and Decrees, and contrary to the determination of the Catholick Church, and ſacred Councils, that what is ſo gotten may be employed in purchaſing of Earldoms and Lordſhips, to beſtow upon people of mean condition, and to prefer them without any precedent merit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

               <p>As touching the priviledges of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> we find, when the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> gave their opinion, and all the Chambers met together about receiving the Cardinal of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> and the qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that ſhould be put to his faculties (which was on <hi>Decemb.</hi> 11. 1501.) the Laws of the Land and the Liberties of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church were repreſented at large, among which this was one, That the King of <hi>France</hi> cannot be excommunicated, that his Kingdom can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be put under an Interdict, as is collected out of the Antient Regiſters.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of this Century, Mr. <hi>John le Maire</hi> one of the <hi>French</hi> Hiſtorians wrote his Book of Schiſm, and therein gives us to underſtand, that there were endeavours then for the Reformation of the Church. Every good Chriſtian (ſaith he) ought to pray to God, that the two laſt Councils of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, may engender one great, Univerſal, and general Council of all the <hi>Latin</hi> Church, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that Church, as well in the Head as the Members; ſo as the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils uſe to do. And that if it be not kept at <hi>Lyons,</hi> it may be kept in ſome other place moſt expedient and neceſſary for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good: which may be very well done at this preſent, conſidering the great peace, amity and union which is betwixt the two greateſt Potentates in Chriſtendom, the Emperour and the King, together with a third confederate in the League, the Catholick King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> who ought altogether to reform the abuſes of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Which Reformation muſt of neceſſity be made.</p>
               <p>Thus he ſpeaks of the aforementioned <hi>Pragmatick Sanction.</hi> Foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much (ſaith he) as the Pope's are not content, that the <hi>Pragmatick Sanction</hi> be in force, although it be founded upon the Holy Canons,<note place="margin">Le Maire en la 2 part. de la dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer de ſchiſmes.</note> and Authorized by the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> but it derogates from the unſatiable covetouſneſs of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> therefore they ſay it is a pure Hereſie.</p>

               <p>To croſs this Council, the Pope (following the advice of <hi>Anthony de Mont</hi> of St. <hi>Sanſovin,</hi> one of the eight Cardinals newly created at <hi>Ravenna</hi>) appointed a general Council on <hi>May</hi> 1. at St. <hi>John de Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> in <hi>Rome.</hi> And to keep the King's forces quiet, he colourably gave ear to a peace, which the Biſhop of <hi>Tivoli</hi> his Nuncio, and the King of <hi>Scots</hi> Ambaſſadour treated for him with the King, and the Cardinals of <hi>Nantes</hi> and <hi>Strigonium</hi> with the Pope.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Julius</hi> having been ſick, and being freed from the fears of death, he makes a new League with the Senate of <hi>Venice,</hi> and the King of <hi>Arragon</hi> againſt the <hi>French:</hi> to maintain (as he ſaid) the union of the Church, to defend it from apparent Schiſm, and to recover all ſuch places as depended either mediately or immediately upon the Church.</p>
               <p>The firſt day of <hi>September</hi> being come, the Cardinals Attorneys in their names do celebrate the Acts appertaining to the opening of the Council at <hi>Piſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Pope being wroth, declared <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Piſa</hi> ſubject to the Eccleſiaſtical cenſure, by vertue of the Bull of the Council which he had cauſed to be publiſhed: and he pronounced the abovenamed Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals void of the Dignity of Cardinals, and ſubject to the puniſhments of Hereticks and Schiſmaticks.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Florentines</hi> and <hi>Piſans</hi> appeal from this curſe to the Holy Council of the Univerſal Church. At the firſt Seſſion the Cardinals call the Clergy to aſſiſt in the Cathedral Church: but not one appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: the Prieſts deny their Ornaments to the Cardinals offering to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the Maſs, and ſhut the Church doors; ſo that the Cardinals fearing they ſhould not remain ſafe in <hi>Piſa,</hi> decreed to have the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil tranſported to <hi>Milan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They found the like difficulties at <hi>Milan.</hi> The Clergy abſtain from ſaying Service, as before accurſed perſons; the Commons curſe them and openly deride them, eſpecially the Cardinal of St. <hi>Croix,</hi> choſen Preſident of the Council. This dealing of the <hi>Milanois,</hi> made them to tranſport the Council to <hi>Lyons,</hi> where <hi>Julius</hi> was ſuſpended from his Popedom: and prohibitions were made throughout all <hi>France,</hi> not to ſend any Money to <hi>Rome,</hi> nor to bring any Bulls from thence. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Pope <hi>Julius</hi> did not only excommunicate all the <hi>French,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo granted Bulls of pardon to any one that ſhould kill a <hi>French-man,</hi> giving the Realm of <hi>France,</hi> and that of <hi>Navarr</hi> (in hatred of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Albret,</hi> allyed to the King, and at the perſwaſion of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Arragon</hi>) in prey to the firſt conquerour.</p>

               <p>But King <hi>Lewes</hi> XII. beat the Pope in a Battle near <hi>Ravenna,</hi> which beating wrought this effect, that the King was ſued to,<note place="margin">Vid. Nich.

               <p>But that which might make <hi>Rome</hi> bluſh (if there were any ſhame in her brow) is, that pardons and indulgences are denyed to the poor and indigent, who are not of means ſufficient to raiſe theſe criminal and inceſtuous impoſitions.</p>

The Goſpel was preached in <hi>Saxony,</hi> and embraced there, as alſo at <hi>Halberſtat, Hamburgh, Pomerania, Liveland,</hi> and many other places.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>In the year 1523. the Goſpel began to be openly preached in <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Gratianople</hi> in the <hi>Daulphinatè</hi> by <hi>Peter Sebevilla.

               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Wits, curious by Nature, and deſirous of Novelties, began at firſt rather for paſtime than through choice to read his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and frequent his Sermons.

               <p>The foundation of this Doctrine was in the City of <hi>Geneva,</hi> ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate upon the Lake Antiently called <hi>Lacus Lemanus,</hi> upon the confines of <hi>Savoy;</hi> which having rejected the Government of the Duke and Biſhop, to whom formerly it paid obedience under the name of <hi>Terra Franca,</hi> under pretext of liberty of conſcience, reduced it ſelf into the form of a Common-wealth. From thence books coming out daily in print, and men furniſhed with Wit and eloquence inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves into the Neighbour Provinces, who ſecretly ſowed the ſeeds of this new Doctrine, in progreſs of time, all the Cities and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> were filled with it, though ſo covertly, that there appeared openly only ſome few marks and conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of it.</p>
               <p>This began in the time of King <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, who though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he made ſevere reſolutions againſt the preachers and profeſſours of this Doctrine, yet notwithſtanding being continually buſied in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Wars took little notice thereof.</p>

                  <hi>John Clerk</hi> was apprehended at <hi>Melden</hi> in <hi>France, Anno</hi> 1523. for ſetting up upon the Church-door a certain Bill againſt the Pope's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons lately ſent thither from <hi>Rome;</hi> in which Bill he named the Pope to be Antichriſt. For which he was three ſeveral days whipped, and afterwards had a mark imprinted in his Forehead, as a note of infamy. His mother being a good Chriſtian-woman (though her Husband was an Adverſary) when ſhe beheld her Son thus grievouſly ſcourged, and ignominiouſly deformed in the face, did boldly encourage her Son, crying with a loud Voice, <hi>Bleſſed be Chriſt, and welcome be theſe prints and marks.</hi>

               <p>Then <hi>Wolfgangus Schuch,</hi> coming to a certain Town in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> called St. <hi>Hippolitus,</hi> and being received in the Town for their Paſtor, laboured by all means to root out of the hearts of the people Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and ſuperſtition. Hereupon Duke <hi>Anthony</hi> Prince of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> threatens the Town of St. <hi>Hippolitus. Wolfgangus</hi> humbly wrote to the Duke in defence both of his Doctrine and Miniſtry, and of the whole cauſe of the Goſpel: and having confuted the Fryars in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, he was condemned to be burnt. Shortly after his death, the Commendator of St. <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Vienna,</hi> who ſate as ſpiritual Judge over him, and gave ſentence of his condemnation, fell down ſuddenly and dyed.

               <p>In the beginning of the year, 1525. was the Battle of <hi>Pavia,</hi> where <hi>Francis</hi> I. the <hi>French</hi> King was taken Priſoner, and carried to <hi>Madrid</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> but after many Months confinement he is enlarged, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into <hi>France.</hi>

               <p>I muſt now return back to the Reign of King <hi>Francis</hi> I.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lutherans</hi> having preſented a confeſſion of their Faith, the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> being aſſembled before the Emperour in a Hall (<hi>Anno</hi> 1530) capable to receive 200 perſons,<note place="margin">Hiſt. Concil. Trident. li. 1.</note> it was read with a loud voice. And the Cities which followed the Doctrine of <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> preſented apart the confeſſion of their Faith, not differing from the former but only in the point of the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> The confeſſion of the Princes was afterwards from this place called, the <hi>Auguſtan Confeſſion.</hi> The Pope's Legate would not cenſure the confeſſion, but gave order that a confutation thereof ſhould be read, and no Copy given.</p>
               <p>The Pope was diſpleaſed with the Emperour, for meddling in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but eſpecially for promiſing a Council.</p>
               <p>He writes to all Princes, that he would call a Council, though he never meant it: and his colluſion is diſcovered by many. The <hi>Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants</hi> likewiſe do write to all Princes, praying them not to believe the calumnies raiſed againſt them, and to ſuſpend their Judgements, until thoſe that are accuſed have place to acquit themſelves publickly. And therefore they will deſire the Emperour, that he will call a godly, and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:95405:108"/> free Council in <hi>Germany,</hi> as ſoon as might be, and not uſe force until the matter be diſputed, and lawfully denyed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> King anſwered with very courteous Letters, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance giving them thanks for communicating unto him a buſineſs of ſo great weight.</p>
               <p>He ſhewed them that he was glad to underſtand of their innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and did approve the inſtance they made, that the vices might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, wherein they ſhall find his will to concur with theirs; that their requiring a Council was juſt and holy, yea neceſſary, not only for the affairs of <hi>Germany,</hi> but of the whole Church, that it was not neceſſary to uſe Arms, where the controverſies may be ended with Treaties.</p>
               <p>The Emperour promiſeth the calling of a Council within ſix months. The Pope reſolveth to make an Alliance with <hi>France</hi> to be able to withſtand the Emperour.</p>
               <p>After the Aſſembly of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> at <hi>Smalcald,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King Treateth with the Landgrave of <hi>Haſſia,</hi> at the Pope's requeſt about the Council. The Pope is diſpleaſed for the propoſal of <hi>Geneva,</hi> for the place of the Council. <hi>Anno</hi> 1534. Pope <hi>Clement</hi> VII. dyeth, and Cardinal <hi>Farneſe</hi> is created Pope, and named <hi>Paul</hi> III. He maketh a ſhew that he deſireth a Council: he perſwadeth the Cardinals to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves.</p>
               <p>The cuſtom is, that in the firſt days the Cardinals obtain favours eaſily of the new pope. Therefore the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>French,</hi> in the name of the King, deſired him to grant to the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> the nomination of the Biſhopricks, and Abbacies of his Dominion. The Pope's Anſwer was, that in the Council which ſhould be called ſhortly, it was neceſſary to take away the faculty of nomination from thoſe Princes that already had it: which was ſome blemiſh to the Popes his predeceſſours, who had granted them.</p>
               <p>A Bull is made for the convocation of the Council at <hi>Mantua, May</hi> 27. 1537. The Pope prayeth the <hi>French</hi> King, and all other Kings and Princes to be there in perſon.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> approve not the Bull of convocation.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> makes a Grant of his City, and afterwards recalleth it. The King of <hi>England</hi> oppoſeth the Council by a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick manifeſt.</p>
               <p>Then the Pope ſent out a Bull for the convocation of the Council at <hi>Vicenza.</hi> The Legates went to <hi>Vicenza</hi> at the time appointed; and the Pope to <hi>Nizza</hi> in <hi>Provence</hi> at the ſame time, to ſpeak perſonally with the Emperour and the <hi>French</hi> King, which he gave out was only to make peace between thoſe great Princes, though his principal end was to draw the Dukedom of <hi>Milan,</hi> to his own houſe, <hi>Anno</hi> 1538.</p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:95405:109"/>
               <p>The Council intimated is ſuſpended during pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The Emperour gave order for a Dyet to be held in <hi>Germany,</hi> where <hi>Ferdinand</hi> thought good, inviting the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Princes to be there in perſon, and promiſing publick ſecurity unto all. Cardinal <hi>Farneſe</hi> hearing of this concluſion made without his knowledge, went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately away: and paſſing by <hi>Paris,</hi> obtained of the <hi>French</hi> King a ſevere Edict againſt the <hi>Lutherans:</hi> which being publiſhed was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted in that City, and after through all <hi>France</hi> with much rigour, King <hi>Francis</hi> commanded that all ſhould be appeached who had Books differing from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that made ſecret Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles; that tranſgreſſed the commandments of the Church; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially that obſerved not the Doctrine of Meats; or prayed in any Tongue but the <hi>Latin;</hi> and commanded the <hi>Sorbonniſts</hi> to be diligent Spies againſt them. Afterwards underſtanding the Emperour's cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, who aſſayed to incite the Pope againſt him, he cauſed the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> to be really proceeded againſt, and commanded that a form to diſcover and accuſe them ſhould be inſtituted in <hi>Paris,</hi> propoſing puniſhments to the concealers of them, and rewards to the Delators.</p>
               <p>This was done, <hi>Anno</hi> 1542.</p>
               <p>The Emperour gave divers orders to the Prelates of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries;</hi> and commanded that the Divines of <hi>Lovain</hi> ſhould aſſemble together, to conſider of the Doctrines which were to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; which they reduced to XXII. heads, without confirming them by any place of Scripture, but explicating Magiſterially the concluſion only</p>

                  </hi> and the re-eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Pragmatick Sanction.</hi> And others doubting that the King would be offended by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the <hi>Concordat,</hi> made between him and <hi>Leo</hi> (which would neceſſarily follow) gave counſel not to ſet that diſputation on foot.</p>
               <p>And afterwards, becauſe there were divers opinions in that School concerning the Sacraments; unto which ſome gave effective Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial vertue, and others not, every one deſiring that his opinion ſhould be an Article of Faith, nothing could be concluded, but that they ſhould keep themſelves within compaſs of the XXV. heads publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed two years before.</p>
               <p>The Council is appointed to be in <hi>Trent,</hi> and thither the Legates are ſent. While they meet in <hi>Trent</hi> to convince Hereſies by a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, in <hi>France</hi> they did the ſame by force of Arms, againſt a ſmall
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:95405:109"/> remainder of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> Inhabitants of the <hi>Alpes</hi> of <hi>Provence,</hi> who (as hath hath been ſaid before) maintained a ſeparation from the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> with divers Rites and Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Theſe Men after the Reformation of <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> enlarged their Doctrine by his, and reduced their Rites unto ſome form at the ſame time when <hi>Geneva</hi> embraced the Reformation.</p>
               <p>Sentence was pronounced againſt theſe many years before by the Parliament of <hi>Aix,</hi> which had never been executed. The King now commanded to execute the Sentence.</p>
               <p>The Preſident muſtered together as many Souldiers as he could in the places bordering upon them, and in the Pope's State of <hi>Avignon,</hi> and went with an Army againſt theſe poor Creatures, who had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Weapon nor thought, otherwiſe than by flight to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, thoſe that could. They went not about to teach them, or by threats to make them leave their Rites and opinions; but firſt of all filling all the Countrey with Rapes, ſlew as many as ſtood to their mercy, becauſe they could not fly, without ſparing young or old. They rather razed the Countries of <hi>Cabriers</hi> in <hi>Provence,</hi> and of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindol</hi> in the County of <hi>Viinoiſin</hi> belonging to the Pope, and all other places in thoſe Precincts. More than 4000. perſons were ſlain. They that fled to the Woods and Mountains, partly were famiſhed, partly otherwiſe ſlain, partly ſent to the Galleys: twenty five perſons that fled into a Cave near the Town of <hi>Muſſy</hi> were ſmothered to death with ſmoak.</p>
               <p>Certain of the <hi>Helvetians</hi> ſued unto the <hi>French</hi> King to favour the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> but no entreaty would ſerve. But the bloody Tyrant <hi>Minerius</hi> the Governour of <hi>Provence,</hi> eſcaped not the juſt Judgement of God: for God ſmote him with a terrible Diſeaſe, and he felt as it were a fire burning him from the Navel upward, and the lower parts were rotten and conſumed away with Vermine, with an extream ſtink, and profuſion of Blood in place of his Urine, and ſo with great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he ended his wretched Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lewes de Vaine,</hi> Brother-in-law to the ſaid <hi>Minerius,</hi> the Preſident, and alſo the Brother, and the Son-in-law to <hi>Peter Durant,</hi> Maſter Butcher of the Town of <hi>Aix,</hi> theſe three did ſlay one another upon a certain ſtrife that fell between them. And upon the ſame day the Judge of <hi>Aix,</hi> who accompanied <hi>Minerius</hi> in the ſame perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as he returned homewards going over the River of <hi>Durance</hi> was drowned.</p>

His anſwer was tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the Judgement of reaſonable men.</p>

               <p>Then he Printed the ten Commandements in great Letters, and in ſuch a form, that they might be fixed upon Walls of Houſes for common uſe: and ſo did he with a ſum of the Bible.

But the King gave him a Warrant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print, both the Ten Commandements, and the ſum of the Bible, both in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>French.</hi> They ſummoned him to appear before them, ſaying, that his work was worſe than the Teaching of <hi>Luther.</hi> Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen perſons did approve him, and added their ſeals unto his atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <p>At this time flouriſhed <hi>Francis Vatablus, Regius Prefeſſor</hi> of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Tongue in <hi>Paris.</hi> King <hi>Francis</hi> ordered him to expound the old Teſtament out of the Original, and his Hearers did write his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and his Annotations. The King's Printer dealeth with the Hearers, and receives from them a new Tranſlation, which he printeth with the old Tranſlation, and with the Annotations. This work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfected in the year, 1545. he ſheweth it unto ſome of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity, entreating them to ſhew him, if any part thereof had not been rightly obſerved by the Hearers, to the end if there be any thing amiſs, he may amend it. They do approve the work, and aſſure him, that no evil could proceed from the Lectures of <hi>Vatablus.</hi> But the Books being ſold, ſome obſerved, that the Tranſlation and the Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations were contrary unto the preſent Doctrine of the Univerſity, and therefore the Books ſhould not be ſold ſeeing they were Printed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge of the Faculty.</p>
               <p>The Printer goeth unto the Court, and ſheweth <hi>Peter Caſtellan</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Maſcon,</hi> that the Univerſity was offended, and intend to hinder the ſelling of his Books. He ſeeing the Biſhop doubtful what advice to give, ſaith, if the Divines will give him their cenſure, he is willing to Print it with the Bible, and he will neither be aſhamed, nor take in ill part, to advertiſe the Reader of whatſoever errour is in the Book.</p>
               <p>This overture did pleaſe the Biſhop, and he relates all unto the King, who willeth the Biſhop to write in his name unto the Univerſity, that they ſhall reviſe the Tranſlation and the Annotations, and note what doth not pleaſe them, and ſubjoyn unto every fault a reaſon of their Judgement; and deliver their cenſure to be printed either apart, or with the Bible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſtellan</hi> writes ſo unto them, and they promiſe to obey. But they were often required to deliver their cenſure: They evade it; and ſend unto the Divines of <hi>Lovain,</hi> entreating them to reckon that Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:95405:111"/> among the Heretical and forbidden Books.</p>
               <p>The King was informed of their ſhifts, and of that Letter: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ordereth the Biſhop to require them again. After divers exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to this purpoſe, they ſend fifteen places which they had marked. The Biſhop conferreth with their Deputy <hi>Gagneius</hi> upon theſe Inſtances, and writes a large Letter unto them commending the Annotations, and ſhewing what courſe they ſhould obſerve in their cenſure.</p>
               <p>They were the more enraged at that commendation, and would not go on in their cenſure, but would have the Book to be condemned which they had declared Heretical. Then the King ſent his Letters Patent, and ſealed, charging them to proceed in their cenſure, and to deliver it unto his Printer. They do ſtill refuſe, and at that time King <hi>Francis</hi> dyeth, <hi>viz.</hi> on <hi>March</hi> 31. <hi>Anno</hi> 1547.</p>
               <p>His Son King <hi>Henry</hi> II. who ſucceeded him, ſendeth the like charge unto them on <hi>Auguſt</hi> 16. 1547, They return Anſwer, that they ſhall perfect their cenſure before <hi>November</hi> 1. But then in place of the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure they ſend a ſupplication, craving that the Books may be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, becauſe he is a Sacramentarian, and had written that mens Souls are mortal.</p>
               <p>The Printer is informed of it, and addreſſeth himſelf to anſwer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore King and Council. Then they return unto <hi>Paris.</hi> But he ſhews how falſe their calumnies were.</p>
               <p>At that time they ſent unto the King forty ſix Articles which they had collected. It was told unto their Deputies that they had ſpoken of ſome thouſands of Errours, and were theſe all turned to forty ſix? They anſwered, the Univerſity had more, but had not as yet put them in form.</p>
               <p>The Printer returns to <hi>Paris,</hi> chiding ſome of the Divines for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing him falſly.</p>
               <p>The Printer craves of the King protection from the malice of his Enemies. The King grants it under his Seal. This ſtorm being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, he gathereth fifteen old Manuſcripts of the new Teſtament in <hi>Greek,</hi> and printeth it with the divers lections on the Margin, and gives the firſt copy unto <hi>Caſtellan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Pope ſends into <hi>France Jerome Boccaferrius</hi> a <hi>Roman,</hi> Cardinal of St. <hi>George,</hi> in ſhew to condole with the King for the death of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to give him joy of the beginning of his Kingdom, but with commiſſion to make confederation with him. The Pope gave the Legate moſt ample power to grant the King all his demands in matter of Benefices, without regarding the Decrees of the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil: a ſtrong Alliance is made between the Pope and the <hi>French</hi> King, and two Cardinals are created at the King's inſtance, <hi>viz. Charles</hi> of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Vandoſme,</hi> of the Blood-Royal.</p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:95405:111"/>
               <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> made an open diſcourſe in publick conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the name of the <hi>French</hi> King, ſhewing,<note place="margin">Hiſt. Concil. Trident, li. 3.</note> that King <hi>Francis</hi> had never ſpared any coſt or danger to maintain the liberty of other Princes.</p>
               <p>In conformity whereof <hi>Henry</hi> not degenerating from the vertue of his Anceſtors, as ſoon as he had left to mourn for his Father's death, was willing to declare his obſervance towards the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> That the merits of the Kings of <hi>France</hi> were famous, and exceedeth all thoſe of other Nations. But this was above all which the King now doth, promiſing all his Forces to preſerve the Papal Dignity, now when it is ſo contemned. He prayed the Pope to receive the King for his Son, and to promiſe to himſelf all aſſiſtance from him, and to take care that the Church ſhould receive no damage nor ſhame, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that from ſmall beginnings great factions have riſen, which have brought the Popes into great calamities. He exemplified in many Popes afflicted, who were defended and raiſed by the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> concluding, that the preſent King will not yield to his Anceſtors in preſerving the Dignity of the Apoſtolick See.</p>
               <p>In the year 1549. The <hi>French</hi> King making his firſt entry into <hi>Paris,</hi> cauſed a ſolemn proceſſion to be made, and publiſhed an Edict, wherein he ſignifieth that he received the protection of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion, and of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the care of the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Order, and that he abhorred the Novity of Religion, and teſtified unto all his will to perſevere in the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to baniſh the new Hereticks (ſo he called the <hi>Proteſtants</hi>) out of all his Dominions.</p>
               <p>He cauſed this Edict to be printed in <hi>French,</hi> and ſent it into all parts of his Kingdom. He gave leave alſo to his Prelates to make a Provincial Aſſembly to reform the Churches: Which being known at <hi>Rome,</hi> was thought to be a bad example, and might be a beginning to make the <hi>French</hi> Church independent of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He cauſed alſo many <hi>Lutherans</hi> to be put to death in <hi>Paris,</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf being preſent at the Spectacle: and in the beginning of the next year, he renewed the Edict againſt them, laying grievous puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the Judges, who were not diligent in detecting and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing them.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Paul</hi> III. dyeth, <hi>Anno</hi> 1549. the Cardinals were divided into three factions about the choice of a new Pope, Imperialiſts, <hi>French,</hi> and dependents on the dead Pope, and by conſequence, on his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews.<note place="margin">Hiſt. of Cardin. part 3. li. 2.</note> They made agreement among themſelves, that nine Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals ſhould be named, of each Faction three: but that the nominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be made by two only of the Faction of <hi>France;</hi> and that
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:95405:112"/> afterwards it ſhould be lawful for the Imperialiſts to take one of the ſaid nine at their pleaſure, and that the reſt ſhould be obliged to concur.</p>
               <p>Of the <hi>French</hi> Faction accordingly were named, the Cardinals of <hi>Lorrain, Tornon,</hi> and <hi>Bellai.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the Imperial Faction <hi>Theatino, Monte,</hi> and <hi>San Marcello,</hi> and three others of the other Faction, <hi>Salviati, Ridolfi,</hi> and <hi>Trani.</hi> The Imperialiſts refuſed all the nine perſons which were named, which gave great offence to the other two Factions, inſomuch that it was propoſed by the <hi>French</hi> to the <hi>Farneſians,</hi> to unite among themſelves, and to chooſe a Pope in ſpite of the Imperialiſts. But they could not agree in the choice of their perſons, becauſe there were ſeveral Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals among the <hi>Farneſians,</hi> who were much obliged to the Emperour, and much afraid of his diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>But after a tedious diſcuſſion of the Cardinals for the ſpace of three months, during the vacancy of the See, <hi>Gio Maria del Monte</hi> was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Pope on <hi>February, Anno</hi> 1550. by the name of <hi>Julius</hi> the third. And now the Faction of the <hi>Nipotiſme</hi> was introduced into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave, having over-powred the Factions of the Emperour and King of <hi>France,</hi> with no ſmall reputation.</p>
               <p>The Council having been tranſlated to <hi>Bolonia,</hi> the Emperour ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving proteſted againſt it, the Pope deliberates about the remitting of it to <hi>Trent.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> King offered to the Pope whatſoever he was able to do for him, promiſed to aſſiſt the Council, and to ſend the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of his Kingdom, and all favour and protection for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Papal Authority.</p>
               <p>The Book of <hi>Francis Duraneus</hi> a learned Lawyer, entituled <hi>De Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cris Eccleſiae Miniſteriis</hi> came forth, <hi>Anno</hi> 1551.</p>
               <p>At this time a War was denounced againſt King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond by the Pope and the Emperour, and that upon an unjuſt quarrel. He gave ſome hopes (ſaith <hi>Onuphrius</hi>) of compoſing the differences in Religion,<note place="margin">Onuphr. in Julio 3.</note> when at the requeſt of the Emperour, he declared by his Bull in the firſt year of his Popedom, that the Council ſhould be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Trent</hi> at the beginning of the next <hi>May.</hi> And preſently after he addeth, he unwittingly put himſelf upon the War of <hi>Parma,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſet all <hi>Italy,</hi> nay all <hi>Europe</hi> on fire.</p>
               <p>The firſt Seſſion of the Council on <hi>May</hi> 1. 1551. and the ſecond upon the firſt of <hi>September</hi> were only for Ladies, for there was nothing done. King <hi>Henry</hi> II. ſet forth an Edict at the ſame time, dated the third day of <hi>September</hi> the ſame year, containing a reſtraint of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſporting Gold and Silver to <hi>Rome:</hi> where he ſets down at large the occaſions of the War of <hi>Parma,</hi> begun by the Pope. And among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things he ſaith. <hi>Which holy Father upon a ſudden fit of Choler, had cauſed a certain company of Men of War, both Horſe and Foot to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:95405:112"/> be levied and ſet forth: and alſo enticed and perſwaded the Emperour (with whom we were in good Terms of Peace and Amity) to take Arms, to aid his forces in the deſign of the recovery of</hi> Parma. <hi>And after he had haraſſed and laid waſt all things whatſoever he pleaſed in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of</hi> Parma,<note place="margin">Edict du Roy Henric. 2. impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me a <hi>Paris</hi> l'ann 1551.</note> 
                  <hi>he cauſed his ſaid Forces to march toward the Territories of</hi> Mirandula: <hi>which hath for a long time, even during the Life of our late moſt Honoured Lord and Father, been in the known protection of the Crown of</hi> France, <hi>which he beleagured, uſing moſt incredible and inhumane cruelties towards the Inhabitants of the ſaid Territory; yea ſuch as Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians and Infidels would not have uſed the like: giving the World to know very ſtoutly that he meant them to us, who have not deſerved any ſuch things at his hands, or the Holy See.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There were ſix Seſſions holden in the time of that War, thoſe two forementioned, and four more: in two whereof the moſt material points of Faith, of Manners and Church Diſcipline, were diſcuſſed and determined, as thoſe of the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, Penance and extreme Unction; as alſo about the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of Biſhops, where many blows were ſtruck at the Liberties of the <hi>French</hi> Church, and the rights of the Crown.</p>
               <p>Another Edict of King <hi>Henry</hi> II. was made at the Camp near <hi>Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denaggbes, May</hi> 21. 1552. and Printed at <hi>Paris</hi> the ſame year. From this time till the beginning of the year, 1560. the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> did nothing. What time Pope <hi>Pius</hi> IV. as ſoon as he got into the Chair, ſent forth a Declaration for the continuation of it againſt <hi>Eaſter</hi>-day the next year.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> King makes preparation for a National Council, and proteſteth againſt the Council then aſſembled in <hi>Trent. Jacobus Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hiſt. Concil. Trident. li. 4.</note> Abbot of <hi>Belloſana</hi> appeared in the name of the <hi>French</hi> King, with Letters of his Majeſty, which he preſented to the Legate, deſiring they might be read, and his credency heard. The Legate receiving them, gave them to the Secretary to be read.</p>
               <p>The Superſcription was, <hi>Sanctiſſimis in Chriſto Patribus Conventûs Tridentini.</hi> Much fault was found with the word <hi>Conventûs.</hi> The Biſhop of <hi>Mentz</hi> ſaid, if they would not receive a Letter from the King of <hi>France,</hi> who called them, <hi>Sanctiſſimus Conventus,</hi> how would they hearken to the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who called them <hi>Conventus Malignanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um?</hi> Then the King's Letter was opened and read.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> King diſmiſſeth the Pope's Nuncio: but fearing that by his diſſention with the Pope, thoſe that deſired change of Religion would make ſome innovation, or that himſelf might come into the bad opinion of his people, as if his mind were averſe from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith, and perhaps to open a way for reconciliation with <hi>Rome,</hi> he made a moſt ſevere Edict againſt the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> confirming all the other which he had publiſhed before, adding greater puniſhments,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:95405:113"/> more ways to diſcover the guilty, and greater rewards to the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Hereupon many were apprehended, condemned and burnt, as I have ſhewed before in the Table of <hi>French</hi> Martyrs, concluding it at the year 1557.</p>
               <p>On the fifth of <hi>September,</hi> 1557. in <hi>Paris,</hi> at night about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred perſons were aſſembled in an houſe to celebrate the Communion, which being diſcovered by the common people, the houſe was aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſome fled, but the women and weaker ſort were taken, and ſeven were burnt, and the greater part of the others reſerved for the ſame puniſhment to be inflicted when the complices were found out. The <hi>Suiſſes</hi> made interceſſion for theſe, and the King gave order that the proceeding againſt them ſhould be moderate, but the Pope is angry with the <hi>French</hi> King, for uſing any moderation.</p>
               <p>But the number of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> being now increaſed in <hi>France,</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ir courage increaſed alſo.

                     </gap>
                  </note>The multitude firſt laughed at the Novity; then leaving the ſports joyned themſelves unto the ſingers. And the number of thoſe who came to that place began to increaſe more than uſually. The Pope's Nuncio told the King of this Novity, as of a thing pernicious and dangerous, becauſe (ſaid he) the Miniſteries of Religion, uſually celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Church in the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue by Religious men only, were put into the mouth of the common people in the vulgar Language, which was an invention (ſaid he) of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> telling him that if he did not reſiſt the beginnings, all <hi>Paris</hi> would be <hi>Lutheran.</hi> The King gave order that the principal Authours ſhould be proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, wherein they went not very far, having found <hi>Anthony</hi> King of <hi>Navar</hi> and his Wife in that number. But for hereafter it was forbid upon pain of death.</p>
               <p>The King now underſtanding that ſome of the Parliament were <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> in a Mercurial (ſo they call the Judicature inſtituted to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine and correct the actions of the Counſellours of Parliament, and Judges of the King) held in <hi>Paris, June</hi> 15. 1558. where they were to treat of Religion, after the congregation was aſſembled, entred in perſon. And having commanded them to proſecute the things begun, <hi>Claude Viole</hi> one of them, ſpake much againſt the manners of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the bad cuſtoms grown to be pernicious errours, which have cauſed the new Sects.</p>
               <p>Therefore it was neceſſary to mitigate the ſevere puniſhments, until the differences of Religion were removed, and the Eccleſiaſtical Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:95405:113"/> amended by Authority of a General Council, the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for theſe evils, as the Councils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> have judged, commanding that one ſhould be celebrated every ten years.</p>
               <p>His opinion was followed by <hi>Ludovicus Faber,</hi> and ſome others, <hi>Anno du Bourge,</hi> did add, that many villanies were committed condemned by the Laws, for puniſhment whereof, the rope and fire were not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, <hi>viz.</hi> frequent blaſphemies againſt God, perjuries, Adulteries, not only ſecret, but even cheriſhed with impudent licenſe; making himſelf to be plainly underſtood, that he ſpake not only of the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees of the Court, but of the King himſelf alſo: adding that while men lived thus diſſolutely, divers Torments were prepared againſt thoſe who were guilty of nothing but of publiſhing to the World the vices of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and deſiring an amendment of them.</p>
               <p>In oppoſition of all this, <hi>Egidius Magiſter,</hi> the prime Preſident, ſpake againſt the new Sects, concluding that there was no other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but that which was formerly uſed againſt the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> of whom <hi>Philip Auguſtus</hi> put to death ſix hundred in one day, and againſt the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> who were choaked in the caves, whither they retired to hide themſelves.</p>
               <p>All the voices being given, the King ſaid, he had how heard with his own Ears, that which before was told him; that the contagion of the Kingdom doth hence ariſe: that there are in the Parliament who do deſpiſe the Pope's Authority, and His: that he well knoweth they are but few, but the cauſe of many evils. Therefore he exhorted thoſe who are good Subjects to continue in doing their duty: and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately gave order that <hi>Faber</hi> and <hi>du Bourg</hi> ſhould be impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and afterwards cauſed four more to be apprehended in their houſes.</p>
               <p>But at the ſame time (as if there had been no danger at all) the Miniſters of the Reformed (for ſo the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are called in <hi>France</hi>) aſſembled in <hi>Paris</hi> in the Suburbs of St. <hi>German,</hi> made a Synod, in which <hi>Francis Morellus</hi> the chief man among them was Preſident, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining divers conſtitutions; of the manner of holding Councils, of removing the domination in the Church; of the Election and Offices of Miniſters; of cenſures; of Marriages, of Divorces, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of conſanguinity and affinity, that throughout all <hi>France</hi> they might not only have an Uniform Faith, but Diſcipline alſo. And their courage did increaſe, becauſe the ſame of the ſeverity uſed in <hi>France</hi> coming into <hi>Germany,</hi> the three Electors, and other <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Princes, ſent Ambaſſadours to the King to diſſwade him from that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour againſt the profeſſours of their Religion. But the King (though he gave them a courteous Anſwer, yet) remitted nothing of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:95405:114"/> but after the Ambaſſadours were gone, he deputed four Judges, of the body of the Parliament, in the cauſes of the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, with the Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Inquiſitor <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony de Mocares,</hi> commanding them to proceed with all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicholas Clinet,</hi> one of the Elders of the Church at <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>Taurin Gravelle,</hi> a Lawyer, and Advocate in the Court of <hi>Paris,</hi> and elder of the ſame Church, were both burnt at <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bartholomew Hector</hi> was burnt at <hi>Thurin.</hi> Miſtriſs <hi>Philippa de Luns</hi> was ſtrangled at <hi>Paris, Anno</hi> 1558. after ſhe had a little felt the Flame with her Feet and Viſage.</p>
               <p>Of the ſame company was alſo <hi>Nicholas Cene</hi> a Phyſician, (Brother to <hi>Philip Cene</hi> above-mentioned and Martyred at <hi>Diion</hi>) and <hi>Peter Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bart,</hi> which two were brought forth to their execution, <hi>Octob.</hi> 2. They were holden long in the Air, over a ſmall fire, and their lower parts burnt off, before that the higher parts were much harmed with the fire. Nevertheleſs theſe Holy Men ceaſed not in all theſe torments to turn up their eyes to Heaven, and to ſhew forth infinite Teſtimonies of their Faith and conſtancy. In the ſame fire many Bibles and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were burnt.</p>

                  <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> after the death of his Wife, <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>England,</hi> was married to <hi>Elizabeth</hi> eldeſt Daughter to King <hi>Henry</hi> II. <hi>Philibert Emmanuel</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> married with <hi>Marguarite</hi> the King's only Siſter: and <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> with <hi>Claude,</hi> a younger Daughter of <hi>Franoe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King yielded to <hi>Philip</hi> all that he had taken from him, as well on this ſide, as beyond the Mountains. To the <hi>Savoyard</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored <hi>Breſſe, Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Piedmont:</hi> to the <hi>Genevois</hi> the Iſle of <hi>Corſe,</hi> and about four hundred places more, conquered during the late fatal Wars, which had made ſo many Provinces deſolate, ruined ſo many Caſtles, Towns and Villages, drunk up ſo much Chriſtian blood, and ſlain ſo many millions of Men of all qualities, retaining nothing but the Territories of <hi>Boullen</hi> and <hi>Calais.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The priſons were now full of the <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> the Marriages of the King's Daughters and Siſter were ſolemnized with all the pleaſures and ſports that could be deviſed. The Court exceeded in ſumptuous Plays, Masks, Dances, and Bon-fires: the people expreſſed publick joy by reaſon of the peace, with loud acclamations in theſe ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. But this pleaſant Comedy was converted by a ſad Cataſtrophe, into a mournful Tragedy. The King on <hi>June</hi> 10. <hi>Anno</hi> 1558. would be one of the Challengers at the Tilt in St. <hi>Anthonie's</hi> ſtreet, being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by the Dukes of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and <hi>Ferrara.</hi> And to run his laſt courſe in favour of the Queen his Wife, he ſent a Lance to the Earl of <hi>Montgomery.</hi> The Earl excuſeth himſelf to run againſt his Majeſty.

               <p>The King when he cauſed <hi>Faber</hi> and <hi>Anne du Bourg,</hi> to be impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, vowed to ſee them burnt within few days if they perſiſted in their opinion, but he was prevented by death.</p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:95405:115"/>
               <p>The King's death in <hi>France,</hi> which the Reformed did aſcribe to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, increaſed their courage, though they durſt not ſhew themſelves openly in <hi>Paris.</hi> For his Son <hi>Francis</hi> the ſecond, the new King, after he was conſecrated at <hi>Rhemes, Septemb.</hi> 20. gave order to proſecute the proceſs of the Counſellours who were in priſon, and deputed the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of St. <hi>Andreas,</hi> and the Inquiſitor <hi>Antonius Democares,</hi> to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Judges having gained ſome of the common ſort formerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours of that Religion, had notice of the places where they ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſembled. Therefore many both men and women were impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and many fled, whoſe goods were confiſcated after a citation by three Edicts. And the example of <hi>Paris,</hi> the ſame was done in <hi>Poytou, Tholouſe,</hi> and <hi>Aix</hi> of <hi>Provence,</hi> by the inſtigation of <hi>George</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Armignac,</hi> who not to abandon that enterprize, would not go to <hi>Rome</hi> to the election of the Pope, uſing all diligence, that thoſe who were diſcovered might be apprehended. The profeſſours of that Religion being ſtirred up hereby, and imboldened, becauſe they knew they were many, ſent about many writings againſt the King and Queen, and thoſe of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> (by whom the King was governed) Authours of the perſecution, intermixing ſome points of Religion, which being willingly read by all, as things compoſed by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick liberty, did imprint the new Religion in the minds of many.</p>
               <p>In the end of the proceſs againſt the Counſellours, after a long conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation all were abſolved, except <hi>Anne du Bourg,</hi> who was burnt on the eighteenth of <hi>December,</hi> not ſo much by the inclination of the Judges as by the reſolution of the Queen provoked againſt him, becauſe the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> did divulge in many writings and Libels ſpread abroad, that the late King had been wounded in the eye by the providence of God, for a puniſhment of his words uſed againſt <hi>du Bourg,</hi> that he would ſee him burnt.</p>
               <p>But the death and conſtancy of a man ſo conſpicuous, did make many curious to know what Religion that was, for which he had ſo couragiouſly endured this puniſhment, and made the number increaſe.</p>
               <p>There was a great conſpiracy in many parts of <hi>France,</hi> into which many were entred, and the major part for cauſe of Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſee poor people drawn every day to be burned at the ſtake, guilty of nothing but of zeal to worſhip God, and to ſave their own ſouls. To theſe were joyned others, who thinking the <hi>Guiſards</hi> to be the cauſe of all the diſorders of the Kingdom, judged it an Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick Act to deliver it from oppreſſion by taking the publick admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration out of their hands.</p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:95405:115"/>
               <p>Both theſe cloaked themſelves with the cover of Religion, to gain more followers: and the better to confirm their minds, cauſed the principal Lawyers of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and the moſt famous <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Divines to publiſh in writing, that without violating the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of a King, and Dignity of the lawful Magiſtrate, they might oppoſe with Arms, the violent Domination of the houſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who offended true Religion and lawful Juſtice, and kept the young King as it were in priſon.</p>
               <p>Great tumults of the people were raiſed in <hi>Provence, Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Poitou;</hi> whither the preachers of <hi>Geneva</hi> were called, and came wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly. By whoſe Sermons the number of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</p>
               <p>This general combination made the Governours of the Kingdom reſolve, that there was need of an Eccleſiaſtical remedy, and that very quickly, and a National Synod was propoſed by the whole Council. The Cardinal of <hi>Armignac</hi> ſaid, nothing was to be done without the Pope, to which opinion ſome few Prelates did adhere. But the Biſhop of <hi>Valence</hi> ſaid, that <hi>France</hi> had Prelates of it's own to regulate the cauſes of Religion, who beſt knew the wants of the Kingdom, that it would be a great abſurdity to ſee <hi>Paris</hi> burn, having the Rivers of <hi>Some</hi> and <hi>Marne</hi> full of Water, and to believe that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter muſt be brought from <hi>Tibur</hi> to quench the fire. The reſolution of the Council was, that there being need of a ſtrong and ſudden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, the Prelates of the Kingdom ſhould aſſemble to conſider of theſe things, and <hi>April</hi> 10. the Synod was intimated for the tenth of <hi>September.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Currier was diſpatcht to <hi>Rome,</hi> to acquaint the Pope with this Reſolution. The Pope blameth the King for pardoning Hereticks, and will not approve the National Synod: but ſendeth a Nuncio into <hi>Spain</hi> to diſſwade it. And the King of <hi>Spain</hi> diſſwadeth the <hi>French</hi> King from the National Synod. Therefore he diſpatched away <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio di Toledo,</hi> Prior of <hi>Lyons,</hi> to pray him not to go on herein. The aſſaulting of <hi>Geneva</hi> was propoſed. But this propoſition was not well taken in <hi>France,</hi> becauſe it would make the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> unite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Beſides, none going to that War, but the Catholicks, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom would be left open to the oppoſites.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> King anſwered, that he would not make a National Council to ſeparate himſelf, but to unite to the Church thoſe that went aſtray, that a general Council would more pleaſe, and in likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood be more profitable, if his urgent occaſions would ſuffer him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the time, which muſt needs be very long: that the National Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil which he deſireth, ſhall depend upon the Apoſtolick See, and the Pope, which ſhall ceaſe when the General ſhall be aſſembled, and ſhall incorporate with it. And that his deeds may anſwer to his words,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:95405:116"/> he deſired the Pope to ſend a Legate into <hi>France,</hi> with power to aſſemble the Biſhops of the Kingdom, and to ſettle the affairs of Religion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> King doth not think <hi>Trent</hi> a fit place for the Council; nor that the Doctrines already diſcuſſed there ſhould be maintained without re-examination.</p>
               <p>This troubled the Pope, who thought it did not proceed from the King's own motion, but from the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were formerly called <hi>Hugonots,</hi> becauſe the firſt conventions they had in the City of <hi>Tours,</hi> (where that belief firſt took ſtrength and increaſed) were in certain Cellars under-ground, near <hi>Hugo</hi>'s gate, from whence they are by the vulgar ſort called <hi>Hugonots.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Theodore Beza,</hi> a man of great eloquence, and excellent Learning, having by his Sermons drawn many to embrace the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, even many of the chief Nobility and greateſt perſons of the Kingdom, their Aſſemblies and Sermons were then no more celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Stables and Cellars, as in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> ſecond, but in the Halls and Chambers of the beſt Gentry, and moſt eminent Nobility.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beza</hi>'s Tranſlation of the new Teſtament, and his accurate notes upon it, have made him famous.</p>
               <p>His <hi>French Pſaltery</hi> was ſo well liked, that it was well Tranſlated into the <hi>German, Bohemian, Engliſh, Scottiſh,</hi> and many Languages: and it is both in uſe and eſteem with all the Orthodox Churches, <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Beza</hi> would repeat whole <hi>Pſalms</hi> in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Chapter one could name out of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, he would rehearſe it all in <hi>Greek,</hi> for the things he had formerly learnt, his Judgement failed him not.</p>
               <p>He lived eighty ſix years, and toward his latter end he began to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get what he had ſpoken. His <hi>French</hi> works are mentioned by <hi>Verdier</hi> in his <hi>Bibliotheque.</hi> His <hi>Latin</hi> are known.</p>
               <p>News was brought unto the Pope, that his Subjects of <hi>Avignon</hi> had taken up Arms againſt him, accounting his ſucceſſion unlawful; becauſe that Countrey was not juſtly taken from <hi>Raimond,</hi> Count of <hi>Tholouſe;</hi> concluding alſo that the Eccleſiaſticks cannot by the commandment of Chriſt, poſſeſs any Temporal Dominion. And reſolving to rebel by the means of <hi>Alexander Guilotimus</hi> a Lawyer, they put themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the protection of <hi>Charles de Montbrun,</hi> who being in Arms for Religion, was much followed in <hi>Daulphinè. Charles</hi> entring the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory with three thouſand foot, made himſelf Lord of the whole Countrey, with much joy of the Inhabitants. <hi>James Maria,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Viviers,</hi> Vice-Legate of <hi>Avignon,</hi> made oppoſition, and very hardly kept the City. The Pope therefore ſent Cardinal <hi>Farneſe</hi> to defend
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:95405:116"/> the City. But the danger was moderated, becauſe Cardinal <hi>Tornon</hi> (whoſe Neece <hi>Charles</hi> had married) made him deſiſt; and go to <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> by promiſing reſtitution of his Goods confiſcated for Rebellion; and to be recalled ſhortly with liberty of Conſcience, if he would go out of <hi>France.</hi> So the Pope's Territory, deprived of that protection, did remain in ſubjection, but full of ſuſpicions, and ready to embrace every Novity.</p>

               <p>All theſe departing from the Aſſembly at <hi>Nantes,</hi> a City in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany,</hi> and returning every one with great expedition to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince allotted him, in a few days working with wonderful ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy, brought a great number of people of ſeveral conditions to be at their devotion.</p>
               <p>The Conſpirators prepared a great multitude, who ſhould appear before the King without Arms, to demand that the ſeverity of the Judgements might be mitigated, and Liberty of Conſcience granted, deſigning they ſhould be followed by Gentlemen, who ſhould make ſupplication againſt the government of the <hi>Guiſards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Conſpiracy was diſcovered, and the Court retired from <hi>Blois</hi> an open place to <hi>Amboiſe</hi> a ſtrong Fortreſs. This troubled the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratours, who while they were thinking of a new courſe, ſome of them who took Arms were beaten and ſlain, and others taken and ſentenced to dye: and to appeaſe the tumult, pardon was granted by the King's Edict, dated <hi>March</hi> 18. to all, who ſimply moved with zeal of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, had entred into the conſpiracy, ſo that they diſarmed within 24 hours.</p>

               <p>Pope <hi>Pius</hi> IV. in his Bull of the publication of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which was for the continuation of it, bearing date <hi>December</hi> 30. 1560. ſheweth in effect, that it was begun, continued, and ended among the troubles in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi> And (as <hi>Sleidan</hi> ſaith)<note place="margin">Sleidan. <hi>l.</hi> 16.</note> as ſoon as new broils were raiſed in the neighbouring parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> and a great war was kindled in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> the Council was afterwards ſuſpended and adjourned.</p>
               <p>After the ſuppreſſion of the Conſpirators forementioned, in a ſecret Council held in the Kings chamber it is reſolved to puniſh the favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the Conſpiracy. And to get the Favourers of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their power, it was reſolved to call an Aſſembly of the States, at which among others the Princes of the Blood are to aſſiſt.</p>
               <p>But the Queen-Mother and the <hi>Guiſes</hi> doubting more than ever new Inſurrections, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> who was as a priſoner is diſcharged of his Guard, and ſet at liberty. He preſently departed from Court, and went into <hi>Bearn</hi> to the King of <hi>Navarre.</hi> The Conſtable, the Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> and the reſt, were entertained with kind Letters and Commiſſions and Charges of truſt.</p>
               <p>The diſſenſions and ſuſpicions of the Grandees in <hi>France</hi> encreaſing, on the 21. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the King called a very great Aſſembly at <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainbleau,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Aſſembly at <hi>Fountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleau.</hi>
                  </note> in which the neceſſities of the Kingdom were declared by the Chancellour, which he compared to a man ſick of an unknown diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. Afterwards <hi>Jaſper Coligni</hi> gave the King ſome Petitions, which he ſaid, were delivered to him by a multitude of people, when he was in <hi>Normandy.</hi> The ſumm of them was, That the faithful Chriſtians diſperſed throughout the whole Kingdom did pray his Majeſty to look on them with a favourable eye: that they deſired a moderation of their puniſhments until their cauſe were heard: and that they might make publick profeſſion of their Religion, to avoid ſuſpicion by private Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>John Monluc</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Valence</hi> ſhewed, That the principal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of theſe diſtempers was to flie unto God, to aſſemble godly men out of the whole Kingdom, to find a way to root out the vices of the Clergy, to forbid infamous and immodeſt Songs, and inſtead of them to command the ſinging of Pſalms and holy hymns in the vulgar tongue: and if the common interpretation be not good, to take away the errours, ſuffering that which is good to be uſed by all.</p>
               <p>Another remedy was, the General Council, alwaies uſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch differences; ſaying, That if a General Council could not be obtained, they were to aſſemble a National: that they did grievouſly err, who troubled the publick quiet with Arms upon pretence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: that their errour was as great who condemned to death thoſe who adhered to the new Doctrine, only for the opinion of piety, who dying conſtantly, and contemning the loſs of their goods, ſtir up the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95405:123"/> minds of the multitude, and make them deſirous to know, what Faith that is for which they endure ſo great puniſhment. <hi>Charles Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillac,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Vienna,</hi> ſpake in the ſame manner, adding, That the diſeaſe of <hi>France</hi> was ſo ſharp, that there was no time to call a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician from far: therefore they were to call a National Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coligni</hi> added, that requiring thoſe who gave him the Petitions, to ſubſcribe them, he was anſwered, That five thouſand men would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe if there were occaſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Guiſe</hi> concerning the point of Religion, ſaid, he refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf unto the judgement of learned men; but proteſted, that no Council ſhould make him decline one jot from the old be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> ſaid, That the Petitions preſented were moſt proud, and that to grant the Orators publick Exerciſe, were to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their Doctrine: he ſaid, that the greater part uſed Religion for a pretence: and therefore his opinion was, they ſhould be proceeded againſt with more ſeverity, mitigating the puniſhment of thoſe who aſſemble without Arms, only for Religion, inſtructing and admoniſhing them: and to this purpoſe to cauſe the Prelates to reſide, hoping that by theſe remedies they would need neither National nor General Council.</p>
               <p>A Decree was made the 27. of that month, That there ſhould be an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the States at <hi>Meaux</hi> the 10. of <hi>December:</hi> and if the General Council ſhall not be called ſuddenly, the Biſhops ſhall aſſemble on <hi>January</hi> 13. to treat of celebrating a National: in the mean-while the puniſhments for cauſe of Religion were ſuſpended, except againſt thoſe who took up Arms.</p>
               <p>The Pope hereupon wrote to Cardinal <hi>Tournon,</hi> to hinder the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Biſhops, and if he could not, to return to <hi>Rome.</hi> The Pope makes ſhew to call a General Council ſuddenly. He received anſwer from <hi>Tournon,</hi> that having tried all means, he was not able to remove the King or any of his Council, nor could hope for any better ſucceſs hereafter. The Pope's ſecret purpoſe was to avoid the Council, or to defer it, but makes a contrary reſolution againſt his Will, and is much troubled with the occurrences of <hi>France.</hi> A Currier went in haſte to <hi>Rome</hi> out of <hi>France,</hi> with proteſtations from the King, that if the General Council were not called, he could no longer defer the National: adding, that if any place in <hi>France</hi> were choſen for the meeting of the Council, it ſhould be moſt ſecure.</p>
               <p>Then the Convocation of the Council was publiſhed in the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, the Bull whereof was entitled, Of the <hi>Intimation</hi> of the Council of <hi>Trent:</hi> the Latine word was <hi>Indictionis. Vergerius</hi> wrote a Book againſt this Bull.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:95405:123"/>
               <p>At this time News came to <hi>Rome,</hi> that the <hi>French</hi> King had impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and ſet a guard upon the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> which pleaſed the Pope much, as a thing that might hinder the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Council. <hi>Saga</hi> ſervant to the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> is taken at <hi>Eſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes</hi> with divers letters about him, and being tortured confeſſeth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain practices againſt the Crown. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to poſſeſs himſelf of <hi>Lions,</hi> but without ſucceſs. The Governour of the City condemned many of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> to be hanged, and the reſt he ſent alive to the Court, who ſerved afterwards to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Depoſitions of the Priſoners againſt the diſcontented Princes.</p>
               <p>The King departeth with his Guard from <hi>Fountainbleau</hi> and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneth the States to meet at <hi>Orleans,</hi> where the firſt thing that was done was to make a profeſſion of their Faith. Which being ſet down by the Doctors of the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> conformable to the belief of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and publickly read by the Cardinal of <hi>Tournon,</hi> Preſident of the Eccleſiaſtical order, was by a ſolemn Oath approved and confirmed by every one of the Deputies: becauſe none ſhould be admitted into that General Aſſembly, either unwittingly, or on purpoſe, that was not a true Catholick.</p>
               <p>Then the High Chancellour in preſence of the King propoſed thoſe things which were neceſſary to be conſulted of for the reformation of the Government. But this was the leaſt thing in every mans thought, for the minds of all men were in ſuſpence about the Prince of <hi>Conde's</hi> impriſonment, who being interrogated, excepts againſt his trial, and appeals to the King: but the Appeal is not accepted: and he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be held as convict, becauſe he had refuſed to anſwer the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates. So they proceeded judicially, until the very laſt pronouncing of ſentence.</p>
               <p>The Commiſſaries having pronounced the ſentence againſt the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the King one morning being under the Barbers hand, was on a ſudden taken with an Apoplexy, and laid by his ſervants on his bed, and on <hi>Decemb.</hi> 5. he died.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> IX. brother to <hi>Francis,</hi> and ſecond Son to the Queen, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the Crown, being yet but about eleven years old: in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his Minority the Government fell principally upon the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> as firſt Prince of the Blood. <hi>Navarre</hi> did almoſt openly favour the new Religion, and was wholly governed by the Counſel of <hi>Jaſper Coligni</hi> the old Admiral, who made profeſſion of it: ſo that the Proteſtants were more confident to obtain liberty of Religion, as they deſired. They aſſembled almoſt publickly. Hereupon the King's Mother and the chief of the Council, reſolved to hold the States at <hi>Orleans,</hi> and begun to do it on the 13. of <hi>December,</hi> where the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Religion was debated. The Chancellour ſhewed, That there
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95405:124"/> was need of a Council, which the Pope had promiſed: and that in the mean time it was not to be tolerated, that every one ſhould ſhape out his own Religion, and bring in new rites at his pleaſure. He ſaid, That it was neceſſary that the names of <hi>Lutherans, Hugonots</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> (no leſs factious than thoſe of the <hi>Guelphs</hi> and <hi>Gibilines</hi>) were to be taken away; and Arms to be taken againſt thoſe who co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their avarice, ambition, and deſire of innovation with the cloak of Religion. <hi>John Angelo,</hi> Advocate in the Parliament of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> ſpake much againſt the bad manners and diſcipline of the Clergy. <hi>James</hi> Earl of <hi>Rotchford</hi> ſaid, That all the preſent evils did ariſe from the large donations made by the King and other Grandees to the Churches, eſpecially of juriſdictions: in the end he gave a Petition in the name of the Nobility, demanding to have publick Churches for their Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jacobus Quintinus,</hi> a <hi>Burgundian,</hi> ſpake for the Clergy: he ſaid, The States were aſſembled to provide for the neceſſities of the Kingdom, not to amend the Church which cannot err, though the Diſcipline in ſome ſmall part may ſomewhat need reformation. He ſaid, That they that demand Churches apart from the Catholicks, are to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed as Hereticks; and that the King ought to force all his Subjects to believe and live according to the form preſcribed to the Church: that thoſe who have forſaken the Kingdom for Religion, ought not to be ſuffered to return: that thoſe who are infected with Hereſy, ought to be proceeded againſt Capitally: that the Eccleſiaſtical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline will eaſily be reformed, if the Clergy be freed from payment of Tenths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the end he demanded, that all priviledges of the Clergy ſhould be confirmed, and all grievances removed.</p>
               <p>The King ordained, That the Prelates ſhould prepare to go to the Council of <hi>Trent:</hi> commanded, that all that were in priſon for Religion ſhould be ſet at liberty, their offences until that time par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and their goods reſtored. The Pope ſends a Nuncio to the Queen-Mother, praying her to be careful of the Religion in which ſhe was born and bred, and not to ſuffer Schiſm to ariſe by too much licence, nor to ſeek remedies elſe-where for the preſent and imminent evils, but from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for which end the Council was intimated.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was ſet at liberty, and by an Edict in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>Paris</hi> abſolved from the imputation laid upon him, and the Sentence declared null and irregular, which was pronounced againſt him, by the Judges Delegates, as incapable of judging the Princes of the blood.</p>
               <p>In <hi>France,</hi> though the Queen and Prelates did deſire to ſatisfie the Pope in referring the cauſes of Religion to the Council, yet a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Prelates was put in order, at which the Pope is offended,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95405:124"/> and ſendeth for Legate the Cardinal of <hi>Ferrara</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> giving him four particular Commiſſions, <hi>viz.</hi> to favour the Catholicks, and oppoſe the Proteſtants: to divert the National Synod, and Aſſembly of the Prelates: to ſolicite the going of the Prelates to the Council: and to cauſe an abrogation of the Conſtitutions made in matters Eccleſiaſtical.</p>
               <p>Afterwards, it was ordained in <hi>France</hi> that the Biſhops ſhould meet in <hi>Poiſy</hi> on <hi>Auguſt</hi> 10.<note place="margin">The Colloquy of <hi>Poiſy</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> and that the Proteſtant Miniſters ſhould have a ſafe-conduct to come thither. At the time prefixed the Prelates aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in <hi>Poiſy,</hi> the Cardinals of <hi>Tournon, Lorain, Bourbon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1561.</note> 
                  <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magnac,</hi> and <hi>Guiſe,</hi> many Doctors of the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> and other Divines ſent for from the moſt famous Univerſities of the Kingdom. There appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Proteſtants, <hi>Theodore Beza, Peter Martyr, Francis de Saint Paul, John Raimond, John Virel,</hi> with many other Preachers, which came, ſome from <hi>Geneva,</hi> ſome out of <hi>Germany</hi> and other neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing places, in number fourteen. Theſe gave a Petition to the King, which had four parts. 1. That the Biſhops might not be Judges in that buſineſs. 2. That the King with his Councellours would preſide. 3. That the Controverſies might be decided by the word of God. 4. That what ſhould be agreed on and decreed, might be written by Notaries elected by both parties. The Queen would have one of the four Secretaries of the King to write, and granted that the King ſhould preſide, but ſo, that this ſhould not be committed to writing, alledging that it was not fit for them, nor profitable for the King, conſidering the preſent times. Before the Parties were called to the combate, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates made a Proceſſion, and did all Communicate, except the Cardinal <hi>Chaſtillon,</hi> and five Biſhops. The others proteſted one to another, that they meant not to handle points of Doctrine, nor matters of faith.</p>
               <p>The ſecond of <hi>September</hi> they began in preſence of the King,<note place="margin">Hiſt. Concil. <hi>Trident. li.</hi> 5.</note> Queen, Princes of the blood, and the King's Councellours, together with ſix Cardinals, and forty Biſhops. The King ſpake, deſiring them to labour to compoſe the differences of the Kingdom, and not to depart till that were done. The Chancellour ſpeaks more largely to the ſame purpoſe. The Queen commandeth <hi>Beza</hi> to begin. Who having prayed on his knee, and recited the profeſſion of his Faith, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that they were accounted ſeditious, and perturbers of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick peace, though they had no other end than the glory of God, nor deſired to aſſemble themſelves but to ſerve him, and obey the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates appointed by him. Then he declared in what the Proteſtants agree with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in what they diſſent: he ſpake of faith, of good works, of the authority of Councils, of ſins, of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Diſcipline, obedience to Magiſtrates, and of the Sacraments: and entring into the matter of the Euchariſt, he ſpake with ſuch heat,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95405:125"/> that he was commanded to conclude. And having preſented the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his Churches, and deſired it might be examined, he made an end. Cardinal <hi>Tournon</hi> diſdaineth at <hi>Beza</hi>'s ſpeech. The Queen anſwered, that nothing was done but by the advice of the Princes of the King's Council, and the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> not to change or innovate any thing in Religion, but to compoſe the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</p>
               <p>The Aſſembly being diſſolved, the Biſhops and Divines conſulted what to do. The Congregation being again aſſembled the 16. of the month, the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> makes a long Oration for the Papiſts, to whom <hi>Beza</hi> was willing to anſwer, but was not ſuffered. But on the 24. day in another Aſſembly <hi>Beza</hi> ſpake of the Church, and of the conditions and authority thereof, ſhewing they may err, and the dignity of the Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eſpenceus</hi> anſwered, he had alwaies deſired a colloquy in matter of Religion; and abhorred the puniſhments the Proteſtants had endured: but he much wondred by what authority the Proteſtants were called into the Eccleſiaſtical Miniſtery, who had laid hands on them to make them ordinary Miniſters? and if they pretended an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary vocation, where were the miracles to demonſtrate it? Then he treated of Traditions, ſhewing that many things are believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Tradition only, as the <hi>Conſubſtantiality</hi> of the Son, the Baptizing of Infants, and the Virginity of the Mother of Chriſt after his birth. He added, that no General Council was ever corrected by another in point of Doctrine. Divers Replies and Diſputations paſſed on both ſides, ſo the Colloquy was put off till the next day.</p>
               <p>In which <hi>Beza,</hi> who began to ſpeak, provoked the Biſhops. For having juſtified his vocation to the Miniſtery, he diſcourſed of the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of thoſe Prelates, ſhewing what Simony was committed: and paſſed from thence to the Article of the Euchariſt. The parties not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to agree, a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Jeſuite having reproached the Proteſtants, did reprehend the Queen for meddling in matters which belonged not to her, but to the Pope, Cardinals, and Biſhops. Finally, not being able to conclude any thing by this manner of parly, it was orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that two Biſhops and three Divines of the moſt moderate, ſhould confer with five of the Proteſtant Miniſters, to ſee if they could find out a way to make an agreement. But this doth as little good as the former: ſo an end was put to the Colloquy.</p>
               <p>The Pope was glad to hear that the Colloquy was diſſolved without doing any thing, and much commended the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain,</hi> and <hi>Tournon</hi> more. The zeal of the Jeſuite pleaſed him. He ſaid the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Chancellour was heretical in many parts, and threatened to call him into the <hi>Inquiſition.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:95405:125"/>
               <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Ferrara</hi> had been received by the King and Queen with much honour, and acknowledged for Legate of the Apoſtolick See. But the Parliament having diſcovered, that among his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, one was to deſire a revocation or moderation (at the leaſt) of the things accorded in the States of <hi>Orleans</hi> concerning the diſtribution of Benefices, and particularly the paying Annates to <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing money out of the Kingdom to obtain Benefices there, or other favours, did immediately publiſh the Decrees, which had hot been publiſhed until that time, under the date of <hi>September</hi> 13. that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal might not obtain his purpoſe, and did reſolve not to give the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate lieve to uſe the faculties given him by the Pope. For the cuſtom of that Kingdom is, that a Legate cannot exerciſe his office, if his faculties be not firſt preſented, and examined in Parliament, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by a Decree thereof, and confirmed in that form by the King's Brief: So that when the Bull of the Faculties of the Legation was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to be approved, it was refuſed by the Chancellour and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Beſides, Paſquins were made and ſpread abroad, concerning the loves of <hi>Lucretia Borgia</hi> his Mother, and Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> VI. his Grandfather by the Mother's ſide, with repetition of the obſcenities, divulged throughout all <hi>Italy,</hi> in the time of that Popedom, which made the Cardinal ridiculous to the people.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing he undertook, was to hinder the preaching of the Reformatiſts, who after the Colloquy did practiſe it more freely than before. To gain reputation he made acquaintance with the Nobles of the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> and went to their feaſts, and ſometimes was preſent at their Sermons in the habit of a Gentleman. But this diſpleaſed the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Queen-Mother underſtanding that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> took the Colloquy in ill part, ſendeth an Ambaſſadour into <hi>Spain</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe it.</p>
               <p>After the Colloquy was ended, and the Proteſtants departed, the Prelates remained, and treated of the Communion of the Cup; the Biſhop of <hi>Valence</hi> with conſent of the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain,</hi> propoſing, that if it were allowed, the increaſe of the Proteſtants would be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. But the major part would not conſent it ſhould be done, but by grant, or (at leaſt) by favour of the Pope.</p>
               <p>Lieve is given to the Legate by the King's Brief to exerciſe his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, which the Chancellour refuſeth to ſubſcribe, according to the ſtyle of the Kingdom; Yet was it ſubſcribed by the Queen, the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and by the principal Officers of the Kingdom. For this favour, he began to think well of the Communion of the Cup, and to write thereof to <hi>Rome.</hi> In concluſion of the Aſſembly at <hi>Poiſy,</hi> the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates granted power to the King to ſell an hundred thouſand crowns of the yearly rents of the Lands of the Church, ſo that the Pope would allow it.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:95405:126"/>
               <p>The Legate informeth the Pope, that there are but two wayes to preſerve Religion in <hi>France.</hi> One, to give ſatisfaction to the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and to intereſt him in the defence of it: the other, to grant the people generally the Communion <hi>ſub utraque ſpecie.</hi> And the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour deſireth the Pope to grant the Communion of the Cup to the <hi>French</hi> men. The Pope giveth a favourable anſwer, for which afterwards he was ſorry, and at length reſolveth not to grant the Communion of the Cup to the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the ſame time when the Petition of the <hi>French</hi> Prelates was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in <hi>Rome,</hi> News came out of <hi>Germany,</hi> that the ſame men had ſent to the Proteſtants there to perſwade them to perſevere in their Doctrine, promiſing to favour them in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and to draw other Prelates to do the like, for which they are ſuſpected in <hi>Trent</hi> and in <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Nuncio reſident in <hi>France,</hi> returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> who having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the ſtate of that Kingdom, the Pope wrote to the Legate, that he ſhould repreſent to the King's Council, that the Council in <hi>Trent</hi> was to be celebrated for <hi>France</hi> only; becauſe neither <hi>Italy</hi> nor <hi>Spain</hi> had need of it, and <hi>Germany</hi> did refuſe it, and tell them, that therefore it did concern them to promote it.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Hiſt.

And the Judges (as in a Comedy) cauſed the Bidel of the Univerſity to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent his perſon, and to make a publick ſatisfaction and recantation, forbidding the Divines to diſpute ſuch queſtions hereafter, making them go to the King to ask pardon for having ſuffered ſo important a matter to be diſputed on, and to promiſe to oppoſe themſelves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes againſt that Doctrine. For which the <hi>French</hi> men are much cenſured in <hi>Rome.</hi> The Pope promiſeth a reformation in the Court, and haſteneth the opening of the Council.</p>

Two divers tumults were raiſed by Sermons, one at <hi>Dijon,</hi> the other in <hi>Paris.</hi> Hereupon the Preſidents of all the Parliaments were called, and certain Councellours Elected to deliberate what was beſt to be done. All theſe being Aſſembled at Saint <hi>German,</hi> where the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour told them, That the differences in Religion ſhould be referred to the Prelates: but when the Peace of the Kingdom is in queſtion, this could not belong to the Eccleſiaſticks, but to thoſe whom the King would appoint to conſult of it. That this Particular was then to be conſidered of, whether it were good ſervice for the King to permit or prohibit the Congregations of the Proteſtants, wherein they were not to diſpute which Religion was the better, becauſe they took not in hand to frame a Religion, but to put in order a Republick. In the end they concluded that the Edict of <hi>July</hi> was to be remitted in part, and the Proteſtants to have lieve to Preach. The Edict contained ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Points. That the Proteſtants ſhould reſtore the Churches Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and other Eccleſiaſtical goods uſurped. That they ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear

That the Miniſters ſhall be bound to ſwear to the Publick Officers, not to offend againſt this Edict, nor to Preach any Doctrine contrary to the <hi>Nicene Council,</hi> and the Books of the Old and New Teſtament.

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> the Conſtable, and the Cardinals (among which the Cardinal of <hi>Tournon</hi> was lately dead) with the Marſhals of <hi>Briſac</hi> and St. <hi>Andre</hi> being diſcontented hereat left the Court, contriving how they might hinder the execution of the Edict, and oppoſe the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. But becauſe they ſaw, that whilſt the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> ſtood united with the Regent, they had no right to intermeddle with the Government of the Kingdom, therefore they propoſed to themſelves to diſſolve that Union. And knowing, that the Queen intended to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue with the ſame power till her Son came of Age, they thought it more eaſie to gain the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who was already much averſe to the Proteſtants Religion by reaſon of the different opinions he found among them about the Points in Controverſie. And now the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> joyns himſelf with the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and the <hi>Conſtable.</hi> Theſe three the <hi>Hugonots</hi> called <hi>the Triumvirate.</hi> Queen <hi>Joan</hi> was highly diſpleaſed at this ſo unexpected deliberation of her Husband, and leaving the Court, carrieth with her Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Katherine,</hi> her Children (whom ſhe brought up in <hi>Calviniſm</hi>) into <hi>Bearn,</hi> being determined to ſeparate her ſelf from the Counſels and converſation of her Husband. The Queen Regent was alſo terrified herewith, and in oppoſition to the <hi>Triumvirate</hi> joyns with the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and the Admiral. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> takes upon him openly to Head the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> who ardently deſire to revenge his paſt affronts upon thoſe that were his chief perſecutours. His power and boldneſs was moderated by the wiſe Counſel of the Admiral of <hi>Chaſtillon.</hi> Their Authority led after them, being of the ſame Faith, the Prince of <hi>Porcien,</hi> the Count <hi>de la Roch-fou-caut, Meſſieurs de
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95405:128"/> Genlis, de Grammont,</hi> and <hi>Duras;</hi> the Count of <hi>Montgomery,</hi> the Baron <hi>des Adrets, Meſſieurs de Bouchavane,</hi> and <hi>Soubize,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other the Principal in the Kingdom. Thus upon a ſudden the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> went over to the Popiſh party, and Queen <hi>Katherine</hi> (though diſſemblingly) took upon her the Protection of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. The King of <hi>Navarre</hi> ſtaying in <hi>Paris,</hi> laboureth to hinder the Aſſemblies of the Proteſtants, to diminiſh their force and credit, and finally to take away their liberty of Religion.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> being likewiſe in <hi>Paris,</hi>

The King of <hi>Navarre</hi> deliberating to drive the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> out of <hi>Paris,</hi> for this purpoſe ſends for the other Popiſh Lords to Court. The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> makes a journey thither, and paſſing through <hi>Vaſſy,</hi> his Servants heard a noiſe of Bells; and having askt what was the reaſon of it, anſwer was made, That it was the hour wherein the <hi>Hugonots</hi> uſed to Aſſemble at their Sermons. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Lacquies of the Duke that went before the reſt of the Company, moved with the Novelty of the thing, and a curioſity to ſee (for then thoſe Congregations began firſt to be kept in Publick) with jeſting ſpeeches and a tumult went towards the place where the <hi>Hugonots</hi> were Aſſembled at their Devotion. Who underſtanding that the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> their great Perſecutour, was there, and ſeeing a great Troop come directly toward them, inconſiderately fell preſently to gather up ſtones, and began to drive back thoſe that advanced firſt to the place of their Aſſembly. By which injury the Popiſh party raſhly betook themſelves to Arms. The Duke putting himſelf in the midſt of them, was hit with a blow of a ſtone upon the left cheek, which bled much, which cauſed him to withdraw from the hurly-burly. His followers impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of ſuch an affront done to their Lord, with their fire-arms pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently aſſaulted the houſe whither the <hi>Hugonots</hi> retired to ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, killed above ſixty of them, and grievouſly wounded the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; who climbing over the Tyles ſaved himſelf in ſome of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning houſes. The tumult being ended, the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> called for the Officer of the place, ſharply reproving him for ſuffering ſuch a pernicious Licence to the prejudice of Paſſengers. He excuſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as unable to hinder it, by reaſon of the Edict of <hi>January,</hi> which tolerated the publick Aſſemblies of the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> the Duke no leſs offended at his anſwer than at the thing it ſelf, laying his hand upon his Sword, replyed in choler, <hi>This ſhall ſoon cut the Bond of that Edict, though never ſo binding.</hi> From which words many afterwards conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that he was the Authour of the enſuing War.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Hugonots</hi> incenſed by this Chance, now full of rage, ſtirred up ſuch horrible tumults and bloody Seditions, that (beſides the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of men in many places) the Monaſteries were ſpoiled, Images
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95405:129"/> thrown down, the Altars broken, and the Churches defiled. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in all places ran headlong to take Arms; and the Heads of the Factions went about gathering Forces, preparing themſelves for a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt War. And now each Faction deſired to draw the King to their party, and to poſſeſs the Perſons of the King and Queen. But the Catholicks prevent the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> and lead them both to <hi>Paris</hi> from <hi>Fountainbleau.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> therefore poſſeſſeth <hi>Orleans,</hi> and prepareth for the War. The Popiſh Lords under the King's name likewiſe raiſe an Army. Many writings are publiſhed on each ſide, and both Armies go into the Field. The Queen-Mother labours for a Peace. To this end ſhe comes to a parley with the Prince, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſucceſs: notwithſtanding ſhe continues to Treat of an Agreement, which at length is concluded. But the Prince by the perſwaſion of the reſt, again takes Arms, purpoſeth to aſſail the King's Camp by night, but miſſeth of his deſign. Forces come to the King's aid out of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and many thouſands of <hi>Swiſſes,</hi> whereupon the Prince is forced to retire unto the Walls of <hi>Orleans,</hi> where being unable to keep the Army together, he divides it. He ſendeth for ſuccour from <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> conſents to give <hi>Havre de Grace</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and to receive their Garriſons into <hi>Deipe</hi> and <hi>Roven,</hi> to obtain aid from them. The King's Army takes <hi>Blois, Poictiers, Tours,</hi> and <hi>Bourges,</hi> beſieges <hi>Roven</hi> and takes it, and ſacks it, where <hi>Anthony</hi> King of <hi>Navarre</hi> received a Musket ſhot in the left ſhoulder; which breaking the bone, and tearing the Nerves, he preſently fell down on the place as dead, and died ſhortly after.</p>
               <p>Succours come to the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> out of <hi>Germany,</hi> with which being re-inforced he makes haſte to aſſault <hi>Paris:</hi> The King and the Queen arrive there with the Army: and the Prince after many attempts is neceſſitated to depart. Both Armies go into <hi>Normandy,</hi> and there follows the Battel of <hi>Dreux,</hi> in which the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> is taken Priſoner on the one ſide, and the Conſtable on the other. The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> being Victorious, layes ſiege to <hi>Orleans,</hi> and is ready to take it, and is treacherouſly ſlain by <hi>Poltrot, Sieur de Mereborn,</hi> of a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Family, near <hi>Angouleſme.</hi> He feigns to forſake the Proteſtant par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, leaves <hi>Orleans,</hi> inſinuates himſelf into the Duke of <hi>Guiſes</hi> Court: and whilſt the Duke gives order for an aſſault, ſhoots him in the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whereof he dieth. <hi>Poltrot</hi> aided by the ſwiftneſs of his horſe, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf in the neighbouring Woods, and the Duke being carried to his Lodging, died three dayes after of his hurt. <hi>Poltrot</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and being taken, was by ſentence of Parliament publickly quartered.</p>
               <p>After the death of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> an accommodation follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Conditions of Peace were conluded at <hi>Orleans March.</hi> 18. 1563. <hi>viz.</hi> That all thoſe that were free Lords over the Caſtles or Lands
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95405:129"/> that they poſſeſſed, not holding of any but the Crown, might within their juriſdictions freely exerciſe the Reformed Religion; and that the other Feaudataries, who had not ſuch dominion, might do the ſame in their own houſes, for their Families only, provided they lived not in any City or Town. That in every Province certain Cities ſhall be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in the <hi>Faux-bourg</hi> whereof the <hi>Hugonots</hi> might Aſſemble at their Devotion. That in all other Cities, Towns and Caſtles, in the City of <hi>Paris</hi> with the juriſdiction thereof, and all places whatſoever where the Court reſided, the exerciſe of any other but the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion ſhould be prohibited. Yet every one to live free in his Conſcience without any trouble or moleſtation. That the Profeſſours of the Reformed Religion ſhould obſerve the Holy-dayes in the <hi>Roman</hi> Calender, and in their Marriages the Rites and Conſtitutions of the Civil Law. That all the Lords, Princes, Gentlemen, Souldiers and Captains ſhould have a full Pardon for all Delinquencies committed during the time of the War, and every one to be reſtored to his charges, goods, dignities, priviledges and prerogatives. That the <hi>Germans</hi> ſhould be ſent away, and have ſafe-conduct out of the Kingdom: and that it ſhould be in the King's power to recover all his places, Towns and Caſtles from any perſon that ſhould with-hold them from him.</p>
               <p>This Capitulation being publiſhed in the Camp, and in the Court, on <hi>May</hi> 18. the Prine of <hi>Conde</hi> and the <hi>Conſtable</hi> came out of Priſon; and <hi>Andelot</hi> delivered the City of <hi>Orleans</hi> into the Queen's hands: and the Kings Army recovereth <hi>Havre de Grace</hi> from the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> The King cometh out of his Minority. The Queen uſeth divers artifices to work the diſcontented Princes to her will. The King and Queen make a general viſitation of the whole Kingdom.

               <p>For as much as many large Indulgences are moſt commonly granted to Fraternities, as appears by divers of the Pope's Bulls, King <hi>Charles</hi> IX. required in his demands of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> a reformation of the abuſes of ſuch Fraternities. The Council found nothing to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in them, but tacitly confirm'd them, by ordaining, That the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrators of them ſhall give account of their adminiſtration every year unto the Ordinary.

By means of theſe Indulgences, and the ſuperſtition which he uſeth in them, he gains milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men unto himſelf, who devote themſelves ſo much unto him, for the ſpecial favour which they ſuppoſe they receive by the means of theſe Indulgences, that they do not acknowledge any other ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>

At the ſiege of this Town <hi>Martiques,</hi> Governour of <hi>Britany,</hi> was ſlain.

               <p>The Princes now reſolve to make <hi>Languedoc</hi> the ſeat of War, becauſe the Town of <hi>Nimes</hi> was lately ſurprized by the Proteſtants, and many Towns in that Country favoured their Religion.</p>
               <p>This occaſioneth a new Edict of Pacification to be ſet forth, granting liberty of Religion to the Proteſtants again, and for their further ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity the keeping of four Towns during the ſpace of two years, <hi>viz.

The <hi>Admiral</hi> alſo was ſent for, and met the King at <hi>Bloyes,</hi> whom the King ſeemed highly to honour. The Admiral and other Nobles are ſollicited to be preſent at the Marriage.</p>
               <p>The Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> as ſhe was buſied in making preparation for the Marriage, died haſtily by the ſcent of empoiſoned Gloves, which ſhe received from an <hi>Italian</hi> the King's Unguentary. But the Marriage was celebrated notwithſtanding on <hi>Auguſt</hi> 18. <hi>Anno</hi> 1572.</p>
               <p>Soon after, <hi>viz. Auguſt</hi> 22. the Admiral, as he went from the <hi>Louvre</hi> to his houſe, was ſhot with two or three bullets in his arm. This was taken in ill part by the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> deſiring liberty to depart from <hi>Paris.</hi> But the King with ſo many at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations proteſted his diſlike in that matter, and that he would diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſearch out and ſeverely puniſh the Authours of that deed, that in ſome part he quieted the minds of the complainers.</p>
               <p>The King likewiſe came to viſit the Admiral, pitifully lamenting the chance that was fallen out, affirming the diſhonour to be done to him, although the Admiral had received the hurt. He would alſo have had the Admiral tranſported to the <hi>Louvre</hi> for his better ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to which the Admiral ſeemed unwilling. Therefore the King ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſome of his own Guard to attend upon the Admiral's houſe, and the Proteſtants were required to prepare their Lodgings near to the Admiral's houſe, to be a Guard unto him, in caſe any commotion ſhould happen in the Town.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Maſſacre of <hi>Paris Auguſt</hi> 24. <hi>Anno</hi> 1572.</note>All this was done under deep diſſimulation, to put the Proteſtants in ſecurity, that they ſhould not once imagine of the Tragedy that was to come. The night after was the appointed time for the horrible Maſſacre of the Proteſtants that were in <hi>Paris.</hi> THe Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> went from Court, with order from the King to find Preſident <hi>Charron Provoſt des Merchans,</hi> the chief Head of the people of <hi>Paris,</hi> giving him direction to provide 2000. Armed men, who ſhould wear every one a ſhirt-ſleeve upon their left arm, and white Croſſes in their hats, which upon notice given were preſently to execute the Kings commands. That he ſhould cauſe to be in readineſs the Sheriffs (<hi>Echevius</hi> they call them) of the ſeveral Wards, and that upon ringing of the Bell of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95405:133"/> the Palace-clock, lights ſhould be put in every window through the Town: which things were all preſently performed: the Dukes of <hi>Montpenſier</hi> and <hi>Nevers,</hi> with many other Lords of the Court took Arms, all the Guards being in Arms at the Gate, and in the Court of the <hi>Louvre.</hi> At the prefixed hour the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,</hi> and <hi>Monſieur d'Angoleſme,</hi> Grand-Prior of <hi>France,</hi> the King's Baſtard-Brother, with other Commanders and Souldiers to the number of 300. going to the Admiral's houſe, forcibly entred the gate of the Court, kept by a few of the King of <hi>Navarre</hi>'s Halberdiers, and the ſervants of the houſe, which were all killed without mercy.</p>
               <p>The Lords ſtayed below in the Court, and one <hi>Beſme,</hi> a <hi>Lorainer,</hi> and <hi>Achille Petrucci,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Siena,</hi> one of thoſe Strangers which he maintained, with Colonel <hi>Sarlabous,</hi> and the other Souldiers, went up to the Admiral's chamber. He hearing the noiſe, got up, and kneeling down, leaned againſt his Bed, when ſeeing <hi>Cornaſon,</hi> one of his ſervants come frighted in, he asked him what noiſe it was; who anſwered, <hi>My Lord, God calls us to him,</hi> and ran out haſtily at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther door. They preſently entring, <hi>Beſme</hi> ran him into the Breaſt, and the reſt when they had made an end of killing him with their Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, threw his body out of the window into the Court, and preſently it was dragged into a ſtable. In the ſame Palace were ſlain <hi>Teligny,</hi> the Admiral's Son-in-Law, and <hi>Guerchy</hi> his Lieutenant, who wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his Cloak about him died fighting manfully, Colonel <hi>Montau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> and <hi>Raura</hi> Son to the Baron <hi>des Adrets,</hi> with all the reſt that had relation to him.</p>
               <p>Then the Colonel of the King's Guards called the Principal <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots</hi> that were in the <hi>Louvre</hi> one by one, who being come in the Court, were all killed by the Souldiers that ſtood in two long Ranks with their Arms ready for that purpoſe. There died the Count <hi>de la Roch-fou-caut,</hi> the Marqueſs <hi>de Renel, Piles</hi> who had gallantly defended Saint <hi>Jean de Angeli, Pontbreton, Pulviault, Bandine, Francourt</hi> Chancellour to the King of <hi>Navarre, Pardillan, Lavardin,</hi> and others to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 200.</p>
               <p>Then at the ringing the Bell of the Palace-Clock, they fell a killing the <hi>Hugonots</hi> throughout all the Lodgings and houſes where they were diſperſed, making an infinite ſlaughter of them without any diſtinction of Age, Sex, or Condition.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> were kept in the King's Chamber during the Maſſacre, and after are kept Priſoners. They are threatened, except they will renounce that Religion which they profeſſed, they ſhall ſurely die.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Navarre</hi> requeſted the King to regard that new bond of friendſhip that was bound up between them, and not to urge him ſo ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to forſake that Religion wherein he had been trained up from his youth.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:95405:134"/>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> added, that his life was in the King's hands, to diſpoſe of it as it pleaſed him. But as for his Religion he had received the knowledge of it from God, and he would not renounce it for any fear or danger of this preſent life.</p>
               <p>Some of the Proteſtants then lodged in the <hi>Fobers</hi> of S. <hi>German,</hi> as Count <hi>Montgomery,</hi> and the Vidame of <hi>Chartres,</hi> for intercepting of whom the King had given command to the Dean of <hi>Gild</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> to have in readineſs 1000. Armed Souldiers. But theſe Souldiers were not in readineſs; ſo they eſcaped. The Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> the Count of <hi>Angoleſme,</hi> and others, purſued them to <hi>Montfort,</hi> which is eight leagues diſtant from <hi>Paris,</hi> but could not overtake them, and ſo returned back again to <hi>Paris.</hi> Beſides the Nobility, more than ten thouſand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were ſlain, whoſe bodies were laid on heaps upon carts, and caſt into the River <hi>Seine,</hi> which was coloured red with the blood of the ſlain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter Ramus</hi> was ſlain at this time: he was the King's Profeſſour of Eloquence and Philoſophy at <hi>Paris,</hi> in the 36. year of his age. In the 21. year of his age he publiſhed a Logick with animadverſions upon <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> Being murthered, his body was reproachfully dragged up and down the ſtreets, and many of his works unperfected there periſhed. <hi>Jacobus Paſcharius</hi> hath theſe Verſes of him.</p>

                  <hi>John Mercer,</hi> a learned Proteſtant, a man well skilled in the Hebrew tongue, and Hebrew writers, ſucceeded <hi>Vatablus</hi> in the Profeſſion of the Hebrew tongue at <hi>Paris.</hi> He eſcaped at the cruel Maſſacre at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> being thrown into the River, and after put forth his learned Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary on <hi>Geneſis.</hi>

                  <hi>Peter Merlin,</hi> a godly and learned <hi>French</hi> Divine, who was <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi>'s Scholar, was miraculouſly preſerved in that Maſſacre.</p>
               <p>In many other Towns there was a general ſlaughter of Proteſtants. So that within the ſpace of a month more than thirty thouſand were reckoned to be ſlain. To all this Tragedy was added the defection of <hi>Rozarius,</hi> a Preacher at <hi>Orleans,</hi> by whoſe Apoſtaſie, example, and perſwaſions the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> were induced to renounce the Proteſtant Profeſſion for a time. Yet afterwards this ſame <hi>Rozarius,</hi> being gravely admoniſhed of the vileneſs of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie, departed out of <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Germany,</hi> and writ Letters to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> wherein he acknowledged his errour, begged mercy of God, for that he had been a ſnare and ſtumbling block unto him. I read in the life of the learned Dr. <hi>Peter du-Moulin</hi> the elder, that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95405:134"/> his Father <hi>Joachim du-Moulin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See the Life of Dr. <hi>Peter du Moulin</hi> written by his Son.</note> was called to be Miniſter at <hi>Coenures</hi> near <hi>Soiſſons, Anno</hi> 1570. The Protectour of that Church was <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur d'Eſtree,</hi> called ſince <hi>Marques de Coanures,</hi> who then profeſſed the Proteſtant Religion. But when he heard of the great Maſſacre of <hi>Paris, Auguſt</hi> 24. 1572. and that the like was to be ſpeedily exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted over all <hi>France,</hi> he preſently forſook the Proteſtant Profeſſion, and to approve himſelf a true Convert, expelled the ſaid <hi>Joachim du-Moulin</hi> out of <hi>Coenures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then was the good man in great extremity, and in this general Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre the murtherers were ſeeking for him. And how to diſpoſe of his Wife and four little Children he knew not. At laſt this he did, he left his Children with a Woman of contrary Religion half a mile from <hi>Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures.</hi> Himſelf with his Wife fled to <hi>Muret,</hi> a Town belonging to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Sedan,</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Bovillon</hi> of the houſe of <hi>de la March,</hi> who paſſed that way flying from the Court. The Murtherers that were ſent to kill <hi>Joachim</hi> and his Family (for they ſpared neither Age nor Sex) found the Womans houſe where the Children were left. <hi>Ruffina,</hi> the Woman to whom the Children were committed, hid the Children in the ſtraw of a Bed, the ordinary bottom of beds of the lower ſort in <hi>France,</hi> and laid a feather-bed and a blanket over them. Scarce had ſhe laid the blanket, when the Murtherers came into the room, and ſearched it, but lookt not in the Bed. <hi>Peter</hi> then under four years of age, not liking to be thus laid up would cry; but his Siſter <hi>Eſther</hi> then ſeven years old, who had been made apprehenſive of their danger, ſtopt his mouth with her hand, whereby ſhe made him ſtruggle, and to make ſome noiſe; which to drown with another, <hi>Ruffina</hi> pretending to reach ſomething upon a ſhelf made the Pewter fall, and then took it up again with much ruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling till the Murtherers were gone. As ſoon as they were out of doors, ſhe ran to help the Child, whom ſhe found well-nigh ſmothered with the ſtopping of his wind: but he ſoon recovered, and the Children were kept ſafe in her houſe till their Parents ſent for them. Thus God doth many times preſerve the infancy of his ſervants from the rage of Satan and the world.</p>
               <p>The day before that terrible execution, the King diſpatched Poſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to divers parts of the Kingdom, commanding the Governours of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Provinces to do the like: but this Commiſſion was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with more or leſs ſeverity according to their ſeveral inclinations: for the ſame night at <hi>Meaux,</hi> and the daies enſuing at <hi>Orleans, Roven, Bourges, Angiers, Tholouſe,</hi> and many other places, but above all at <hi>Lions,</hi> there was a moſt bloody ſlaughter of the <hi>Hugonots.</hi> On the other ſide, in thoſe places where the Governours were either Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants on the Princes, or followers of the family of <hi>Montmorancy,</hi> the Order was but ſlowly and remiſly executed. And in <hi>Provence</hi> the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95405:135"/> Count of <hi>Tende</hi> refuſed openly to obey it, for which cauſe being a while after at the City of <hi>Avignon,</hi> he was ſecretly made away, and (as it was believed) by the King's Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>The third day after the death of the Admiral, the King accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by all the Princes and Lords of his Court, went unto the Parliament, where he pretended, that he had miraculouſly diſcovered the conſpiracy of the Admiral and his Complices to take away his life, and not his alone, but the lives of the Queen-Mother, and the Dukes of <hi>Anjou</hi> and <hi>Alan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He gave order it ſhould be recorded among the ordinary Acts of that Court, that whatſoever had befallen the Admiral and the reſt of his faction, either in <hi>Paris</hi> or any other part of the Kingdom, was done by his will, order, and expreſs Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>Then he commanded them to proceed to the examination of Priſoners, to defame the memory of the dead by laying open their Rebellions, and by inflicting ſuch puniſhments upon them as the ſtrictneſs of the Law required. And laſtly, he cauſed to be publiſhed, not only in the Parliament, but likewiſe in all the Streets of <hi>Paris,</hi> that they ſhould deſiſt from further effuſion of blood. The Parliament condemned <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quemald,</hi> and <hi>Cavagnes,</hi> two Proteſtant Noble-men. They laboured by torturing them to extort from them a confeſſion of the fore-alledged Conſpiracy. But the Noble-men died conſtant in the true Faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any confeſſion of ſuch Treaſon as was alledged. They were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly torn with Pincers, and their bodies quartered.

               <p>Theſe high projects were hearkened unto, received and favoured in the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Articles of this Aſſociation were firſt drawn at <hi>Peronne</hi> in <hi>Picardy,</hi> but diſguiſed with goodly ſhews to blind them that would examine them more exactly: which were, <hi>To maintain the Law of God, to reſtore the holy ſervice thereof.

To reſtore unto the Eſtates of the Realm their Rights, Preheminencies and Ancient Liberties.</hi> And for the execution of theſe Articles, a certain form of Oath was propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, inflicting pains of eternal damnation to the Aſſociates, that for any pretext whatſoever ſhould withdraw themſelves from this League; and a Bond for ſuch ſhould be enrolled, to employ their goods, perſons, and lives, to puniſh, and by all means to ruine the enemies and pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof, and to puniſh them that ſhould fail, or make any delays by the Authority of the Head, as he ſhould think good.</p>
               <p>This being done, many Poſts went to and fro carrying the news of theſe deſigns. They caſt many Libels through the Streets in many great Towns. They murmure that the Proteſtants are too much ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the Edict. And under this plauſible name of the Church, the people give ear to ſuch as are ready to thruſt them into Mutiny. The King was daily advertiſed of theſe things. But on the other ſide he hated the Proteſtants, and ſought to ruine them by degrees, but not by any Inſtruments without his Authority. His Mother likewiſe hated them to the death. She cauſeth the Duke her Son to come to the Court, and the King to be reconciled to him.</p>
               <p>The King calls an Aſſembly of the States at <hi>Bloyes,</hi> where <hi>Peter d'Eſpinac</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Lions,</hi> and the Baron of <hi>Senecey</hi> are Speakers, the one for the Clergy, the other for the Nobility: and both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a publick Exerciſe of one only Religion in <hi>France. Peter Verſoris,</hi> Advocate in the Court of Parliament in <hi>Paris,</hi> Oratour for the third Eſtate, inſiſts on the Union of all the Kings Subjects in one Religion, but by mild means and without War. The King ſeemed to encline only to alter ſome Articles in the laſt Edicts of Pacification, and not to aboliſh it quite.</p>
               <p>But at length the King conſenteth to root out all other Religion but the Popiſh, to baniſh all Miniſters, Deacons, and Overſeers of the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Religion, and yet to take all his other Subjects of the ſaid Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into his protection, attending that by better inſtructions they might be brought into the boſome of the Church. But the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the Marſhal of <hi>Montmorency, d'Anville,</hi> and other Noble-men, both of the one and the other Religion, refuſing to aſſiſt at this preſent Parliament, conclude a nullity of all that was Decreed to prejudice the Edict of Pacification, proteſting to maintain themſelves in the Rights, Liberties and Freedoms which the laſt Edict

               <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> anſwers more ſharply, That he doth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Aſſembly at <hi>Bloys</hi> for the Eſtates of the Realm, but a Conventicle of perſons corrupted by the ſworn enemies of the Crown, who have ſollicited the abolition of the Edict to the ſubverſion of the Realm. That he hath alwaies honoured the Clergy and Nobility, but he pities the people, whom this Aſſembly at <hi>Bloys</hi> ſought to ruine.</p>
               <p>The chief of the Politicks declare, that they adhere not to any other Religion than that of their Fathers, but they are againſt the taking from the Proteſtants the publick Exerciſe which had been ſo ſolemnly allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. The Duke of <hi>Montpenſier</hi> (being returned) perſwaded to have the Edict confirmed. <hi>John Bodin,</hi> a man famous for Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and experience in State-affairs, one of the Deputies of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of <hi>Vermandois,</hi> ſheweth to the Aſſembly how ruinous and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal the new taking up of Arms would be, repeating from the beginning all the dangers and miſeries of the late Wars, which made a deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on the minds of the third Eſtate. But the other Orders being byaſſed and pre-ingaged, it was determined by plurality of voices, that requeſt ſhould be made unto the King, to eſtabliſh only the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion in the Kingdom, and to exclude for ever all Communion with the <hi>Hugonots.</hi> Nevertheleſs <hi>Bodin</hi> procured certain words to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in the Records of the Order of Commons, to certifie their deſire of unity in Religion without the noiſe of Arms, and the neceſſity of War.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Bodin</hi> was a man eminent as well among Proteſtants as Papiſts, though himſelf profeſſed the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion. His Learning and skill in Politicks, appears in his great Book <hi>de Republicâ. Thuanus</hi> high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commendeth his writings. <hi>Poſſevine</hi> diſlikes his <hi>Methodus Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> becauſe he makes ſuch honourable mention of the Proteſtants there. Some commend his <hi>Theatrum Naturae,</hi> for a choice piece, a Book full of natural curioſities.</p>
               <p>The King gives notice to his Governours, and publiſheth by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents, that he is reſolved to grant the Eſtates their requeſts touching the Exerciſe of one only Religion. And thus the ſixth Civil War begins in <hi>Guienne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During the Parliament the Deputies of the Low Countries demand ſuccours of the King, and the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> for Pfotectour of their Liberties againſt the inſolencies of the <hi>Spaniards. Anjou</hi> is now decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95405:140"/> the King's Lieutenant General. They deliver him a mighty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, with which (contrary to the Oath taken by him in the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the accord, and promiſe paſſ'd with the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and Duke <hi>Caſimire</hi>) he beſiegeth and taketh <hi>La-Charitè</hi> by Compoſition, and <hi>Yſoire</hi> in <hi>Avergne</hi> by force, where the blood of the Inhabitants ſhed without pity by the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> confirmed the Proteſtants in the bad opinion they had conceived of him.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> ſends forth a Navy to Sea under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Lanſac,</hi> which coming before the Iſle of <hi>Ré,</hi> retired, ſeeing the Iſlanders reſolved to fight if they approached. The <hi>Rochellers</hi> Arm ſeven Ships, thoſe of the Iſlands five, entreating aid from <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> to withſtand the force of the Fleet. The Nobility invite all others to charge themſelves willingly for the maintenance of this Army. <hi>Mayenne</hi> aſſaulteth <hi>Brovage,</hi> a little ſquare Town built in a Marſh, recovered out of the Sea, fortified during the third Peace: and after the <hi>Rochellers</hi> had cut off ſix hundred of his men, the Town for want of victuals entred into Capitulation, and departed <hi>Auguſt</hi> 28. 1577. with their Arms and Baggage, leaving the place at the Duke's devotion. But a Peace was concluded at <hi>Poictiers,</hi> and was in the end of <hi>September</hi> Proclaimed with great joy of either party. This laſt Edict cut off ſome Articles of the former, made no mention of Strangers, left their conſciences free, yet without exerciſe of Religion, but in Towns and places where then it was publickly uſed: in the houſes of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen Feudataries or (as they call them) <hi>de Haute juſtice,</hi> free ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was given to every body: but in the houſes of private Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, not above the number of ſeven was allowed, and in a prefixed place in every juriſdiction and Baily-wick, except in <hi>Paris</hi> and ten Leagues about it, and two Leagues compaſs from the Court, whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it ſhould be.</p>
               <p>But the Marſhal <hi>D'anville</hi> (who every day withdrew himſelf fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Proteſtants) ceaſed not to proſecute thoſe by whom he pretended to be injuried in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> under colour of reducing the places of his Government under his own Command. Nor did the <hi>Sieur des Diguieres</hi> in <hi>Dolphinè</hi> dare to truſt the Peace, nor hazard him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the King's word, remembring what had befallen <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brun,</hi> in whoſe company he had made War, and therefore ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Armed for his ſecurity. And the Papiſts when they ſaw the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants meet at their Sermons, could not ſuffer them without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings and detractions, which occaſioned many contentions, and ſometimes dangerous bloody accidents, whereby a great part of <hi>France</hi> (though the Peace was made) continued ſtill in broyls and inſurrections.</p>
               <p>About that time the King created two Mareſchals, men valiant in War, and very prudent in Government, <hi>viz. Armand Sieur de Byron,</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:95405:141"/> and <hi>Jaques Sieur de Matignon,</hi> men free from the Intereſts of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> depending wholly upon the King's will. And <hi>Renato di Birago,</hi> the High Chancellour, being made Cardinal, <hi>Philip Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rault, Viſcount de Chiverny</hi> is choſen in his place.</p>
               <p>In the year 1579. the King ſhews himſelf in publick for a mirrour of Reformation and Piety: he builds many Monaſteries, Chappels, and Oratories, undertakes many Pilgrimages on foot, confirms the brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>Penitents,</hi> erects tne Order of <hi>Jeronomites,</hi> is daily converſant with the <hi>Capuchins</hi> and <hi>Fucillans,</hi> called <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> and by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions erects many Congregations. He carrieth a Crucifix and Beads in Proceſſion, with a Whip at his Girdle. He cauſeth many Books of Devotion to be Printed: And leads a Life more befitting a Cloyſter than a Court. He inſtitutes the Order of <hi>The Knights of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> binding them to Conditions which carry a ſtrict bond to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> dies, and now the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> is by quality the firſt Prince of the Blood, and firſt Peer of <hi>France,</hi> and moſt part of <hi>France</hi> caſt their eyes upon him as upon the Sun riſing.</p>
               <p>This amazeth the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and his adherents, they aſſemble the Heads of their houſe at St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> and endeavour to renew the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique League, which before was almoſt laid aſide: for ſeeing that the King ballanced the forces very carefully with thoſe of the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Lords, and that he would not ſuppreſs that party, which (as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved) he might eaſily have done, and that under ſeveral pretences he deveſted all the dependants of both Factions of their places and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, to beſtow them upon ſuch as ſhould acknowledge them meerly from himſelf, they were the more highly incenſed. Nor could it ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them to ſee the King taken up with Religious thoughts, and addicted to a quiet unactive life: for they knowing his nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they had been converſant from his very Childhood, interpreted that courſe of life to ſubtil deep diſſimulation.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> a man of a very quick inſight, diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judgement, and high thoughts, determined to prevent, and not ſtay to be prevented. In which reſolution he was ſeconded by his Brother <hi>Louis</hi> the Cardinal, a man of an high ſpirit, and great wit, as alſo by <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>San-Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> (both Sons of <hi>Anna d'Eſté,</hi> and therefore his Brothers by the Mother) <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Lorain</hi> Duke of <hi>Aumale,</hi> and <hi>Claude</hi> his Brother, a Knight of <hi>Jeruſalem, Charles</hi> of <hi>Lorain</hi> Duke <hi>d'Elbeuf, Emanuel</hi> Duke <hi>de Mercure,</hi> and his Brothers. Only <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne</hi> proceeded more ſlowly than the reſt, who thinking how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous it would be to hazard their ſafety by raſh reſolutions, adviſed them to proceed with more patience, and more reſpect toward the Lawful poſſeſſour of the Crown. But the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> reſolute in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95405:141"/> his thoughts, by the Authority of his Perſon, Vivacity of his courage, and Eloquence of his Language, drew all the reſt to his Opinion; and excluding his Brothers advice ſetled all his thoughts upon the machinations of the League, for the eſtabliſhment whereof, diſſembling his diſcontents no leſs than his jeolouſies and private intereſts, he made ſhew of ſtirring only for the reſpects of Religion, and the general good, making an ill interpretation of all the King's actions, and with many arts and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances aggravating that danger which he pretended hung over the Catholick Religion in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He grounded his fears upon the death of the Duke of <hi>Alançon,</hi> and the Queens barrenneſs, which in the ſpace of ten years had had no Son, whereby the King dying without heirs of the houſe of <hi>Valois,</hi> the Crown fell to the Princes of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and in the firſt place to the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> whom he termed a relapſed Heretick, and an open enemy to the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion. He urged, that his coming to the Crown, would be the univerſal ruine of Religion, and the total Converſion of all <hi>France</hi> to the Doctrine and Rites of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and therefore ſhewed how all good Catholicks were obliged to look to it in time,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Davil</hi> Hiſt. of the Civil Wars of <hi>France, lib.</hi> 7.</note> and to prevent the terrible blow of that imminent ſubverſion. He ſhewed, that when ſometimes he had been conſtrained to make War againſt the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> he employed the <hi>Mareſchal de Byron,</hi> who (though a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick in outward appearance) was yet by many former proofs known to be a favourer of the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> and intereſſed in their Factions, that therefore he had lately taken <hi>Geneva</hi> into his Protection, ſhewing clearly to all the world how little he eſteemed the Catholick Religion, and how much he was inclined to the enemies of the Biſhop and See of <hi>Rome.</hi> That therefore he had excluded all the Catholick Lords from any acceſs to the Court, or adminiſtration in the Government; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly thoſe who had ſpilt ſo much blood for the preſervation of the Kingdom and Religion; and had brought in a new people that were privy to his deſigns, and friends to the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon.</hi> That therefore he deprived all the old Servants of the Crown of all their Offices and Honours, of the moſt Principal Governments, and moſt ſuſpected Fortreſſes, to put them into the hands of men that were Catholicks in ſhew, but really partial to Hereticks, and inwardly adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to the King of <hi>Navarre.</hi> He added, that notwithſtanding the King's publick ſhews of Devotion, yet in his private Lodgings he gave himſelf over to the unbridled luſts of the fleſh, and to the perverſe ſatisfying of his looſe depraved appetite. From which things ſet forth with many ſpecious reaſons, he concluded it was time to unite themſelves for their own defence, and to deſtroy thoſe deſigns before they were brought unto perfection.</p>
               <p>Now the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> by means of the Preachers and Friers in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95405:142"/> Pulpits and other places of Devotion, labours to inſinuate the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick League into the People.</p>
               <p>Among theſe the chief were <hi>Guilliaume de la Roſe,</hi> a man of great elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, who came afterward to be Biſhop of <hi>Senlis; Jean Prevoſt,</hi> chief Prieſt of S. <hi>Severin,</hi> an eloquent and learned man; <hi>Jehan Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi> by birth a <hi>Pariſian,</hi> and Curate of S. <hi>Benet</hi>'s Pariſh in the ſame City; one <hi>Poncet,</hi> a Frier in the Abby of S. <hi>Patrick</hi> at <hi>Melun; Don Chriſtin</hi> of <hi>Nizza,</hi> in <hi>Provence,</hi> and <hi>Jehan Vinceſtre,</hi> all famous Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers. And finally, moſt part of the <hi>Jeſuites.</hi> And as theſe proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the buſineſs of the League in <hi>Paris,</hi> the ſame was done at <hi>Lions</hi> by <hi>Claude Mattei,</hi> a Prieſt of the ſame Society at <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> by <hi>Mathew de Launoy</hi> Canon of that Cathedral: at <hi>Roven</hi> by Father <hi>Egide Blovin</hi> of the Order of the <hi>Minims;</hi> at <hi>Orleans</hi> by <hi>Bourlate</hi> a very noted Divine; at <hi>Thoul</hi> by <hi>Francois de Roſier,</hi> Arch-Deacon of that Church, and an infinite number of others diſperſed through the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places of <hi>France,</hi> who by their Credit and Eloquence, ſometimes in their Pulpits, ſometimes in the Congregations of the Penitents, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in their ſecret conferences at Confeſſions, did allure the people, and entice them to enter into that Combination; which it is likely very many did, out of a reſpect to Religion, believing that thereby the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> would utterly be rooted out, and the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church be reſtored to its priſtine greatneſs. But many entred into that League invited by other ends, and drawn to it by diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent hopes, or elſe neceſſitated by their particular intereſts, though all ſhrouded themſelves under the ſame cloak of the preſervation and maintenance of Religion. <hi>Charles</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> the third Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Anthony</hi> King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and <hi>Louys</hi> Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Unkle to <hi>Henry</hi> the preſent King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> is deſired for the Head of the League, a man alwaies moſt obſervant of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, and an open enemy to the <hi>Hugonots.</hi> Then the Preachers did publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all places term the King a Tyrant, and favourer of Hereticks; the people did applaud them, and from this deadly hatred which they had conceived againſt the King, his Council and favourites, ſprung that fury which ſoon after was diſperſed over all the body of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On <hi>July</hi> 15. 1582. <hi>Renauld</hi> of <hi>Beaune,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Bourges,</hi> and Primate of <hi>Aquitain</hi> had then ſpoken at <hi>Fountainbleau</hi> in this ſort. The whole Church Chriſtian and Catholick aſſiſted by the Legates and Ambaſſadours of the Emperour, of this your Kingdom, and of all other Chriſtian Princes; Did call, aſſemble, and celebrate the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent,</hi> where many good and wholeſome Conſtitutions, uſeful for the Government of the Church, were ordained. To which Council all the Legates and Ambaſſadours did ſolemnly ſwear, in the behalf of their Maſters, to obſerve and keep, and cauſe it to be inviolably kept by all
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95405:142"/> their Subjects: yea even the Ambaſſadours of this your Kingdom ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly took that Oath. Now it is received, and obſerved by all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Catholick Kings and Potentates, this Kingdom only excepted, which hath hitherto deferred the publication and receiving of it, to the great ſcandal of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, and of the Title, MOST CHRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STIAN, wherewith your Majeſty and your Predeceſſours have been honoured; ſo that under colour of ſome Articles touching the liberty of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, the ſtain of <hi>Schiſm</hi> reſteth upon your Kingdom among other Countries. Wherefore the Clergy doth now moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeech your Majeſty, that you would be pleaſed to hearken to this publication, and make an end of all to the glory of God, and the union of his Church.</p>
               <p>There was a Nuncio from the Pope who arrived in <hi>France</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the year 1583. who proſecuted this matter with great vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency: yet for all this he could not move King <hi>Henry</hi> III. at all, the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> having written to King <hi>Henry</hi> III. concerning it, the King of <hi>France</hi> made him this anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother, Thoſe that told you, that I would cauſe the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>to be publiſhed, were not well-informed of my intentions, for I never ſo much as thought it. Nay, I kiow well how ſuch publication would be prejudicial to my affairs, and I am not a little jealous of the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my Authority, the priviledges of the Church of</hi> France, <hi>and alſo of the obſervation of my Edict of Peace. But it was only propoſed unto me, to cull out ſome certain Articles about Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, for the Reforming of ſuch abuſes as reign in that State, to the glory of God, the edifying of my Subjects, and withal the diſcharge of my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: A thing which never toucheth in thoſe Rules which I have ſet down in my Edicts for the Peace and tranquillity of my Kingdom, which I will have inviolably kept on both ſides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On <hi>October</hi> 14. 1585. the Biſhop and Earl of <hi>Noyon</hi> in the name of the Clergy aſſembled in the Abbey of St. <hi>German</hi> near <hi>Paris,</hi> preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the King a Book, written by the advice of the Prelates of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> They told him, They brought unto him the Book of the Law of God, which they humbly entreated him to receive.</p>
               <p>The Provincial Synod held at <hi>Roven</hi> made this inſtance to the ſame Prince. <hi>After that a good number of Biſhops and Proxies for thoſe that were abſent, together with Eccleſiaſtical Perſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And the Provincial Council of <hi>Aix</hi> in <hi>Provence, Anno</hi> 1585. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition the King at the beginning of the Acts, That he out of his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Piety, would command the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> to be publiſhed, which had ſo exactly provided againſt all dangers, wherein the Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth was then impugned.</p>
               <p>We muſt not think, that theſe earneſt ſolicitations which the <hi>French</hi> Eccleſiaſticks here made, did proceed ſo much from them as from the Pope. One argument hereof which may be alledged, is this, that they were not now intereſſed herein; for moſt of the Decrees which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned them, were admitted; and there was no default in the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, unleſs it were on their part: and one company of them were inſerted in the Edict of <hi>Bloys,</hi> the reſt in divers other Provincial Councils holden afterwards in <hi>France,</hi> the Canons whereof are to be ſeen in Print; at <hi>Roven</hi> 1581. at <hi>Bourges</hi> 1584. at <hi>Tours</hi> 1585. and at <hi>Aix</hi> in <hi>Provence</hi> the ſame year.</p>
               <p>The better to countenance the League forementioned, it is preſented to Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII, that he might bleſs it. The Pope was well-pleaſed they ſhould attempt any thing againſt the Proteſtants, but he did not approve thoſe Popular Rebellions which were made againſt a moſt Chriſtian King, neither would he be the fire-brand of a War which he could not quench; and ſo he ſent the Deputies back without any anſwer.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Navarre</hi> cauſeth the Deputies of the Proteſtants to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble at <hi>Montauban,</hi> to reſolve of the means to maintain themſelves, if the League (abuſing the King's name and authority) ſhould ſeek to offend them.

They ſend forth many Commiſſions in the King's name, that what they did might be thought as done for his Majeſtie's ſervice. The King in the end of <hi>March</hi> diſavows them, and forbids all Leavies of men of War.

               <p>The King of <hi>Navarre</hi> likewiſe ſets forth a Declaration: and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he was accuſed of Hereſy, he anſwereth, That he was born under the toleration of two Religions in <hi>France:</hi> That he will leave that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was bred, when by a Lawful Council they ſhall ſhew him another truth than that which he believeth. He ſaith, he is not relapſed, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was not fallen from his firſt Opinion. That he is no enemy to the Catholicks, for that when the Edicts had granted Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, he preſently laid down Arms. That in all places he maintains his Subjects in the ſame Liberty as he found them after the deceaſe of his Mother. That he hath requeſted of the King a prolongation of the Towns which he holds for aſſurance of the laſt Edict, and will deliver them before the time, ſo as the League lay aſide Arms, and yield un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King the places they had ſeized. That whereas they declare him uncapable of the Crown, it toucheth him very near; yet doth he think leaſt of it, hoping that God by his bounty will long preſerve the King for the good of his Realm, and will give him iſſue to the grief of all his enemies.</p>
               <p>The Queen-Mother (accuſtomed to fiſh in troubled waters) winkt at the Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi> She was contented the Duke ſhould terrifie the King, to make him abandon the Proteſtants, and to force him to baniſh his new Minions from Court, who had brought her in diſgrace with the King her Son. Her ambition moved her hereunto, rather than any deſire ſhe had to advance the Duke, and to bring diſorder and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion into the State, and to ſtand alone in the midſt of theſe furious tempeſts.</p>
               <p>The Heads of the League march with an Army of 12000. men to <hi>Verdun,</hi> a City upon the Confines of the Duke of <hi>Lorain,</hi> which they take. And the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> being entred the City, drove out the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour with all his adherents, and placed <hi>Guittald</hi> in his place. The City of <hi>Thoul</hi> drave out the King's Officers, and freely gave up it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the League.</p>
               <p>The City of <hi>Marſeilles</hi> riſeth in favour of the League, but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators are ſuppreſſed by the reſt of the Citizens. They call the Grand-Prior of <hi>France,</hi> Governour of that Province, who was then at <hi>Aix,</hi> at whoſe coming (though with but 200 Horſe) the Fort <hi>de la Garde</hi> was taken, and in it the Conſul <hi>Daries,</hi> and Captain <hi>Chabanes,</hi> who the next morning were executed, by which ſeverity the City was kept under the King's obedience. The ſame happens at the City of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Lions, Bourges,</hi> and many other places in the Kingdom, ſide with the League. The King laboureth to diſunite the League, by drawing many particular men from that party, as alſo the City of <hi>Lions:</hi> but ſeeing his deſign ſucceedeth not to his mind, he reſolves to Treat an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Confederates. The Queen-Mother goes into <hi>Champagne</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:95405:144"/> to confer about it with the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon.</hi> And after many Negotiations the Peace is concluded.</p>
               <p>The King by his Edict of <hi>July</hi> 18. revokes all other Edicts in favour of the Proteſtants, he commands their Miniſters to depart the Realm, and all his Subjects within ſix Months to make profeſſion of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, or to avoid the Country. He approves the Leaguers Arms, as Levied for his Service, allows of their pretexts, and by ſecret Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles concluded at <hi>Nemours,</hi> contents them in all matters, only with this condition, to leave the League, and inſtantly to lay down Arms. Yet would they have in their power the Towns of <hi>Chalon, Verdun, Thoul,</hi> S. <hi>Diſier, Reims, Soiſſons,</hi> the Caſtle of <hi>Dijon, Beawne, Rue</hi> in <hi>Picardy, Dinan</hi> and <hi>Coneq</hi> in <hi>Britain.</hi> They cauſed the King to pay one thouſand two hundred and ſix crowns, and two third parts for the Strangers which they had Levied. They had a diſcharge for vaſt ſummes which they had taken upon the General Receipts. They ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an hundred thouſand crowns to build a Citadel at <hi>Verdun,</hi> and entertainment for Guards on horſeback for all the Lords of the League. This Peace had made a great breach in the King's Authority.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> ſeeing this Cloud ready to break upon his party, complains that the King hath Armed his enemies with his own forces and Authority, againſt his Eſtate, his blood and himſelf. He layes open by a publick Declaration the cauſes which made the League to take Arms, the vanity of their pretexts, the fruit which all <hi>France</hi> may expect by the Treaty of <hi>Nemours,</hi> &amp;c. He proteſteth by a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and neceſſary defence to maintain the fundamental Laws of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and the Eſtate and liberty of the King and the Queen his Mother.</p>

The Court of Parliament declares the Pope's Bull to be void. The Princes likewiſe proteſt againſt it, and appeal from it as abuſive and ſcandalous unto the next free and General Council.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Navarre</hi> cauſeth the Pope's Bull to be anſwered, and his appeal to be poſted up in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf on <hi>November</hi> 6. in the night. He writes to all the States of the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> exhorting them not to ſuffer the rights of the Succeſſion of the Crown of <hi>France</hi> to be decided in the Conſiſtory of <hi>Rome.</hi> Many Volumes were written againſt and in favour of this Bull by the chiefeſt Wits of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>

The Articles of which they were to Diſpute, were, 1. Of the Supper of the Lord. 2. Of the Perſon of Chriſt. 3. Of Images, Temples, and ſuch like things. 4. Concerning Baptiſm. 5. Of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination.</p>
               <p>The firſt day, <hi>viz.</hi> on <hi>March</hi> 21. Thoſe of <hi>Wortemberg</hi> gave in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Theſes of the Lord's Supper, ſhewing that all do agree that All do eat Chriſt's fleſh, and drink his blood ſpiritually: all do condemn the renting of Chriſt's fleſh with mens teeth; as alſo Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Phyſical or Local preſence. So that the only Queſtion is, whether in the Supper the very body and blood of Chriſt, be verily and ſubſtantially preſent, and be diſtributed and received with the Bread and Wine by the mouth of all them who receive the Sacrament, whether worthy or unworthy, believers or not believers, yet ſo that the believers only receive comfort, and the unbelievers do eat to their own damnation?</p>
               <p>We hold the affirmative (ſay they;) that is, by thoſe Words <hi>[In, with, and under the Bread,]</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Petr.</hi> Eccleſ. Hiſt. Cent. 16. part. 3.</note> we underſtand nothing but that they who eat that Bread, and drink that Wine, do receive Chriſt's body and blood with the Bread and Wine. 2. By the words <hi>[Subſtantially, Eſſentially, Really,</hi> and <hi>Orally,]</hi> we mean no other but the very eating and preſence of his body and blood. 3. They argue from the truth of Chriſt's words, <hi>[This is my body,]</hi> and the Almighty power of Chriſt, ſeeing his words declare his will, and by his power he can give his body unto all Receivers. 4. The manner how the worthy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy receive Chriſt's body, is not expreſſed in Scripture; and we ſay, it is ſupernatural and incomprehenſible by the wit of men, and ſhould not be diſputed, nor curiouſly ſearched.</p>
               <p>Theſe Theſes were given unto <hi>Beza,</hi> as it was appointed, and the next day he brought his anſwer and Propoſitions. The Summ is,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95405:145"/> 1. A Sacrament in the ſtrict ſenſe, is a ſenſible thing appointed (by Divine inſtitution) to be ſeparated from common uſe to ſignifie ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and holy things: and this ſignification conſiſts not in a bare repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, whereby the mind is admoniſhed to conceive the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified (this is the uſe of Pictures) but on God's part: with the ſigns is alſo a very giving of thoſe things which are ſignified and offered unto our ſouls. 2. We teach, that according to Chriſt's Inſtitution, by the Bread is ſignified Chriſt's body, by the Wine his blood: by brea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Bread and pouring out of the Wine are ſignified thoſe grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous torments which he ſuffered for us in his body and ſoul: by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward giving the Bread and Wine, the ſpiritual giving the things ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt unto our ſouls: by outward taking the ſigns is ſignified the ſpiritual receiving of Chriſt by Faith Sacramentally and truly. 3. The Sacramental union of the ſigns and things ſignified conſiſts in a mutual relation, as is now ſaid: for the verity of Chriſt's body (which is local, and circumſcribed both before and after his glorification) cannot conſiſt otherwiſe. Again, many paſſages of Scripture that ſhew the true and Phyſical aſcending of Chriſt from the Earth, and his return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Heaven unto judgement, do confute the Doctrine of <hi>Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation.</hi> 4. When the word <hi>Sacrament</hi> is t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ken in a more large ſenſe, it conſiſts of two things, one Earthly, another Heavenly. We teach, That Earthly things are received by Earthly Inſtruments, <hi>viz.</hi> the Hand and Mouth; but the Heavenly things are apprehended only Spiritually by Faith: becauſe albeit Chriſt's body is a truly Organical body, yet analogy requires, That ſuch as the nouriſhment and end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, ſuch alſo muſt be the manner of receiving it. But the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and end thereof is ſpiritual, that is, they concern our ſpiritual union with Chriſt, and eternal life through him. Therefore the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of receiving thoſe muſt alſo be ſpiritual, by the proper Inſtrument of the ſoul, which is Faith. And therefore ſeeing the bodily receiving of the ſigns, is a pledge of the ſpiritual receiving, theſe words, <hi>[Eat and Drink]</hi> as they are properly ſpoken of receiving the ſigns, ſo are they ſpoken figuratively of the thing ſignified, <hi>viz.</hi> by a Sacramental Metonymy, whereby that which agreeth unto the ſigns, is ſpoken of the things ſignified, and ſo both thoſe receivings cannot be by the mouth. Again, if the ſubſtance of Chriſt's body were received bodily, it ſhould remain in the faithful at leaſt, and they ſhould become the ſubſtantial or bodily members of Chriſt, and ſo the Church were not his myſtical body, but a body verily and ſubſtantially conſiſting of the ſubſtance of his body, and of the bodies of all Believers. 5. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per effect of the Supper is the ſalvation of the worthy Communicants by confirming their ſpiritual union in Chriſt: and another effect (but by accident) is the condemnation of them who come unworthily, that is, ignorant of this myſtery, or meerly incredulous and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95405:145"/> and this condemnation proceeds not from the Supper, but from the unworthy uſing of it.</p>
               <p>Then unto the queſtion (as it was propounded) <hi>Beza</hi> anſwered ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively, not denying that the body of Chriſt is truly offered unto all that come, but to be received by Faith, and not by the Mouth: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the whole Sacrament be tendered unto all that come, yet unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers receive only the ſigns, and they are guilty of Chriſt's body and blood, not which they have received, but which they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned. Unto the two arguments he anſwered, we deny not the truth of Chriſt's words, but we expound them according to the Analogy of Faith contained in the Creed, unto which Faith Conſubſtantiation is contrary. And although Chriſt, as he is God, is Almighty, yet his Manhood is not Almighty: and as he is God he cannot do what he hath not decreed to do, or what is contrary unto his decree; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is not Almighty, but becauſe to change his Will (and ſo to be mutable) is not a power, but an infirmity. But God hath ordained, that Chriſt's body ſhould be local and circumſcribed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> On this Article the Diſputation continued three daies, the one preſſing the truth of the words, <hi>This is my body:</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> urging the Analogy of Faith, and the like phraſe of other Sacraments. Neither of the two would yield.</p>
               <p>Then they paſſed unto the Article of the Perſon of Chriſt. Thoſe of <hi>Wortemberg</hi> agreed that the Son of God hath aſſumed the nature of man, and became like unto us in all things except ſin: that he hath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed this nature into the unity of his Perſon; and he is one perſon; ſo that the two natures are moſt ſtrictly united, not by confuſion or commiſſion, or abſorption, or tranſmutation of either of theſe natures before nor after his aſcenſion: for unto the perfect Perſon of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour both natures are required, neither can the properties of the one nature be the properties of the other; for then would follow an abolition of one of theſe natures. Alſo the properties of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature are the gifts that were given unto him without meaſure, by which he excelleth all men and Angels: In the Perſon of Chriſt is a Communication of properties, whereby the properties of both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are ſpoken of his perſon; and the properties of the one nature are given unto the other, by that Doctrine which is called <hi>Doctrina idio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum.</hi> So when it is ſaid, the Son of God communicates his proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties unto the aſſumed nature (<hi>viz.</hi> his Omnipotence, or Omnipreſence) it is not meant as if he poured into the aſſumed nature (as a thing is poured from one Veſſel into another) his properties; as if humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by it ſelf, or of it ſelf, or conſidered <hi>in abſtracto</hi> without his pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, had proper Omnipotency: neither may we think that his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature is made an infinite ſubſtance, or uncircumſcribed, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended unto all places, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When we ſpeak of the real communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95405:146"/> of properties, we mean not that one nature paſſeth into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but we oppoſe real unto verbal communication, which makes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly names common unto the natures.</p>
               <p>Then the queſtion is, whether for the Perſonal union there be a real communication of properties between the two natures in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; or that the one nature communicates its properties unto the other, and how far this communication is extended? We believe (ſaid they) that upon the Perſonal union follows ſo real a communication of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, whereby the Son of God communicates unto the aſſumed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his omnipotence, omnipreſence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which communication the Godhead becomes not weaker, but his humane nature is exalted, and not aboliſhed, as is the union of the body and ſoul, and the fire and iron. They ſaid, that the humane nature is Almighty, becauſe the Scripture aſcribes to him as he is Man, all Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They added, This our Mediatour is to be adored with all Religious worſhip accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to both natures, for we have not two Chriſts; but of whole Chriſt it is ſaid, <hi>Let all the Angels worſhip him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the morrow <hi>Beza</hi> anſwered thus, There is ambiguity in the word <hi>Communication;</hi> it ſignifies the Perſonal union, and alſo the effects of it. We believe (ſaith he) a real communication, that is, an union of natures: in which union both natures remain diſtinct, both in their own properties; and therefore that communication is not ſo much as verbal, but is as falſe, as if you would ſay, his Humanity is become his Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Although all the properties of the Deity may be attributed unto Chriſt-man, that is, unto his Perſon even named by his Manhood, or <hi>in concreto,</hi> as we ſay, The Man Chriſt is Almighty and eternal: but neither may the natures be ſpoken one of another, neither the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the one be given to the other. For this is a ſure rule, In the Perſonal union both natures remain diſtinct, and they both diſtinctly do what is proper unto them. Briefly, as there are two natures in Chriſt, diſtinct in number, and not ſeparated one from the another, ſo there are two wills, and two workings or operations, but one work as there is but one Perſon. We profeſs alſo that Chriſt reigneth now, and hath all Power both in Heaven and in Earth according to both natures, but not <hi>praeſenter</hi> in reſpect of his fleſh; for now (as the Apoſtle ſaith) we are ſtrangers from Chriſt, and he deſired to be out of the body, that he might be with Chriſt. And it is ſaid, he will come again, <hi>viz.</hi> bodily, and viſibly. Laſtly, in that one adoration of our one and only Mediatour according to both natures, we divide not the Perſon, but we diſtinguiſh the natures: for the <hi>Word</hi> is the true and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute object of our adoration, and adoration is due unto God only. But we exclude not that fleſh from our adoration, leſt (with <hi>Neſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>) we divide his Perſon; yet ſo, that we worſhip that fleſh not in
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95405:146"/> it ſelf, but reſpectively as it is the fleſh of the Son of God. They diſputed on this Article other three daies, but no agreement.</p>
               <p>On <hi>March</hi> 27. Thoſe of <hi>Wortemberg</hi> gave their Propoſitions of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Churches, Images in Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They agreed, That theſe are in themſelves indifferent, if the abuſes be ſhunned.</p>
               <p>Then they gave Theſes of Baptiſm, whether Baptiſm is the Laver of Regeneration in the holy ſpirit? or whether it be only a ſign ſignifying and ſealing adoption? The <hi>Wortembergers</hi> ſaid, It not only ſignifieth and ſealeth adoption, but it is the very Laver of Regeneration. They enlarged hereupon. <hi>Beza</hi> gave his anſwer in writing, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Sacraments are not bare ſigns, but the efficacy of the Holy Ghoſt ſhould be diſtinguiſhed from the power of the water, as they are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. And he declares the words of the Inſtitution, and the effect of Baptiſm. <hi>Jacob Andrews</hi> held there is but one Baptiſm, becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, one Baptiſm. <hi>Beza</hi> ſaid, there is an outward and an inward waſhing. And he rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the <hi>Wortembergers,</hi> becauſe they did not call the blood of Chriſt the thing ſignified in Baptiſm. They asked whether Infants have Faith? <hi>Beza</hi> denied, and the other affirmed it. They queſtioned whether the Elect being ſanctified may loſe faith? <hi>Beza</hi> denied. They asked what hope may Parents have of their Baptized Children? <hi>Beza</hi> ſaid, All ſhould hope well, but we are not Prophets to fore-tell, that this or that Child ſhall be a good or bad man.</p>
               <p>Concerning Predeſtination, Thoſe of <hi>Wortemberg</hi> ſaid, God from all eternity not only foreſaw the fall of man, but hath alſo foreknown and choſen them that ſhall be ſaved, and hath appointed them unto ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is, that they ſhould be ſaved by Chriſt; for the election was made in Chriſt. The number of them who ſhall be ſaved is certain with God. So the queſtion is (ſay they) whether God hath Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated his Elect unto life; ſo that he in his hidden and abſolute judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath appointed the moſt part of men unto eternal damnation, that he will not have them to repent, nor be converted and ſaved? We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve (ſay they) that ſuch Decree cannot be ſhewed by Scripture. They reject thoſe Propoſitions, that Reprobation is the moſt wiſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God, whereby from all eternity he hath conſtantly Decreed, without all unrighteouſneſs; not to ſhew love on them whom he hath not loved, that unjuſtly condemning them he might declare his wrath againſt ſin, and ſhew his glory. The cauſe of the Decree of Election or Reprobation, is his eternal favour toward them who at his pleaſure are appointed unto ſalvation, and his eternal hatred of ill, ordaining whom he pleaſeth unto condemnation. But why he hath appointed theſe men rather than thoſe unto ſalvation or damnation, there is no other impulſive cauſe but his will, <hi>&amp;c. Beza</hi> anſwered thus, What ye deny, <hi>[That the veſſels of wrath, as well as the veſſels of mercy, were
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95405:147"/> ordained from eternity,]</hi> we do affirm, not only becauſe there is a like reaſon of contraries, and the very word <hi>Election</hi> proveth it, but alſo it is declared by the expreſs word of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11. And this is ſo far (ſaid he) from any ground that man can challenge God of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, that he were not unjuſt though he had condemned all men, ſeeing we are all by nature the Children of wrath, and he is debtor to none. We ſay further, that their Condemnation, who in the eternal Decree are left in their corruption, is not rightly attributed unto this Decree: for albeit that which God hath Decreed cannot miſs, but ſhall come to paſs; and ſo they who periſh do not periſh without this Decree: yet the cauſe of the execution or of their condemnation, is not that Decree of God, but their natural corruption and the fruits of it, from which it pleaſed God to exempt them only whom he hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to ſalvation. That there ever was, and is a great a number of them that periſh, the matter it ſelf ſheweth: and Chriſt ſaith, Few are choſen, few do enter in at the ſtrait gate.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, that God will not have them to be converted, and ſaved, it's not to be underſtood as if they were willing, and God reſiſteth their deſire; but that they will not be converted, nor can they will, being forſaken of God, and left in impenitency. He anſwered alſo to the Objections. Then they came to that queſtion, whether Chriſt died for all men? <hi>Jacob</hi> held the affirmative, and <hi>Beza</hi> the negative.</p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Frederick</hi> now thought it time to cloſe, ſeeing no hope of agreement:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Oſiand.</hi> Cent. 16. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 23.</note> he exhorted them to give one another the hand of Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and to abſtain from bitter writings, until God ſhall give them more cauſe of Peace. <hi>Jacob</hi> anſwered, ſeeing they have accuſed us of groſs Errours, how can we acknowledge them as Brethren? <hi>Beza</hi> ſaid, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you refuſe to give us the right hand of Fraternity, neither acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge us as Brethren, we do not regard your hand of friendſhip.

               </p>
               <p>Now the King begins a War againſt the Proteſtants in <hi>Guienne.</hi> The Caſtle of <hi>Angiers</hi> is ſuddenly taken by the <hi>Hugonots</hi> without much difficulty. <hi>Angiers</hi> is a City ſcituate on this ſide the <hi>Loire,</hi> in a ſweet fertil Countrey, well peopled, famous for the ſtudy of the Law, and commodiouſly ſeated to fall into all the Provinces of <hi>Gallia Celtica,</hi> which largely invirons it on every ſide. But this Caſtle of <hi>Angiers</hi> was recovered by the Catholicks before it was relieved, and the Prince
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95405:147"/> of <hi>Conde</hi> not knowing what was done, coming to relieve <hi>Angiers,</hi> was defeated.</p>
               <p>The King ſets forth divers Armies, one under the Duke of <hi>Mayenne:</hi> the Mareſchal <hi>de Byron</hi> marcheth with another Army into <hi>Xantonge.</hi> The King ſets forth two other Armies, one under the Duke of <hi>Joyeuſe</hi> in <hi>Avergne,</hi> the other under the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> in <hi>Provence;</hi> he himſelf goes to <hi>Lions.</hi> Then the Proteſtant Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> raiſe a mighty Army to relieve the <hi>Hugonots.</hi> They ſend an Embaſſie before unto the King of <hi>France,</hi> which encreaſeth the diſcontents, and haſteneth the taking up of Arms. The King ſeeks to perſwade the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> to turn Catholick, and come to Court: he ſends the Queen-Mother to Treat with him in <hi>Poictou</hi> about it. Thoſe of the League are highly diſpleaſed and murmure at it. And from that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the union of the <hi>Pariſians</hi> is fomented, who provide, and Arm themſelves ſecretly. They plot to ſurprize <hi>Bolougne</hi> in <hi>Picardy,</hi> but the buſineſs is diſcovered, and the Town is ſaved.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> being up in Arms in <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Champagne,</hi> takes <hi>Auſonne</hi> and <hi>Rocnoy,</hi> and beſiegeth <hi>Sedan.</hi> The Queen-Mother returns from the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> but without effect. The King makes a new Proteſtation not to Tolerate the <hi>Hugonots</hi> any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. He unites himſelf with the Catholick League to oppoſe the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Army. He ſends the Duke of <hi>Joyeuſe</hi> into <hi>Poictou</hi> againſt the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who coming unexpectedly, cuts off two Regiments of the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Infantry.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> draws his Army together to advance againſt the <hi>Germans</hi> in <hi>Lorain.</hi> The King levieth <hi>Swiſſes,</hi> and raiſeth great For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for the ſame purpoſe. The Count of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> go over to the King of <hi>Navarre</hi>'s party. The Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> united with the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> oppoſeth the entry of the <hi>Germans</hi> into his Countrey. They meet at <hi>Pont</hi> St. <hi>Vincent,</hi> but give not Battel. The <hi>Germans</hi> paſs on into <hi>France;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> followeth them, and the King with his Army advanceth to hinder them from joyning with the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who advancing in the mean time to meet the Duke of <hi>Joyeuſe,</hi> paſſeth the River <hi>Drongne.</hi> The Armies face one another at <hi>Coutras,</hi> and fight with all their Forces, where the Duke of <hi>Joyeuſe</hi> loſt both the Battel and his life.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> fights with the <hi>Germans</hi> at <hi>Villemory,</hi> and <hi>Auneau,</hi> and makes a great ſlaughter of them. The King following the Victory comes up cloſe to the enemies Army. The <hi>Swiſſes</hi> yield themſelves unto him, and the remainder of the <hi>Germans</hi> disband, and betake themſelves to flight. They are followed and defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in many places. The Duke of <hi>Bovillon</hi> with a few horſe making his eſcape by the way of <hi>Roane</hi> and <hi>Lionois,</hi> after many dangers get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to <hi>Geneva,</hi> where he died within a few daies after, leaving his
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95405:148"/> Eſtate to his Siſter, whom he recommended to the care of the Duke of <hi>Montpenſier.</hi> The <hi>Sieur de Chaſtillon,</hi> having often fought with the Forces of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Lionois</hi> with great ſucceſs and valour, got at laſt into <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and retired himſelf into his wonted Government in <hi>Vivarez.</hi> The <hi>Sieur de Clervant,</hi> hid among the <hi>Swiſſes</hi> that went with a ſafe-conduct, eſcaped in their company to <hi>Baſil.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> with a few Horſe, lurking in remote places, got at laſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to his own houſe: and the other Commanders taking ſeveral ways ran very various fortunes. The <hi>Reiters</hi> divided themſelves into two parts, one with the Baron <hi>d'Oeneaw,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Damartin</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through <hi>Savoy,</hi> where being ſhrunk to the number of but five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, they were pillaged by the Duke's Forces. The other with the Baron <hi>de Bouck,</hi> paſſing through <hi>Burgundy</hi> to the Confines of the County of <hi>Mombelliard,</hi> was followed by the Marqueſs <hi>Du-Pont,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> by whom being overtaken without the Borders of <hi>France,</hi> they were all cut in pieces in many ſeveral encounters. Theſe Heads of the League alſo ſacked and burned the Towns and Caſtles of that Country. The <hi>Germans</hi> ſick with Feavers, and weakened with bloody-flix, falling down by the High-wayes, and in the Towns as they paſſed, were miſerably ſlain by the Country-people. Eighteen of them who were left ſick in a poor Cottage in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> had their throats cut with a knife by a Woman, in revenge of thoſe loſſes ſhe had ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained.</p>
               <p>The three thouſand <hi>Swiſſes</hi> which were gone into <hi>Dauphiné,</hi> under the Command of the <hi>Sieur de Cougy,</hi> to joyn with <hi>Leſdiguiers,</hi> Theſe <hi>Swiſſes</hi> accompanied with four hundred <hi>French</hi> Musketiers, as they paſſed the River <hi>Iſare,</hi> were aſſaulted by <hi>Monſieur de la Valette,</hi> Brother to the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> with the Cavalry of <hi>Provence,</hi> and by Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Alfonſo Ornano</hi> of the Iſle of <hi>Corſica,</hi> with the Infantry of <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiné,</hi> and ſo furiouſly charged there, that all the reſt being ſlain upon the place, only ſixty of them eſcaped from ſo great a ſlaughter. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon alſo the <hi>Sieur Leſdiguiers</hi> himſelf was forced to ſeek ſecurity among the Mountains.</p>
               <p>Then the King returned to <hi>Paris</hi> armed, and entred as it were in triumph on <hi>December</hi> 23. 1587. but the whole glory redounded to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who being become admired, was celebrated by the tongues and pens of all his adherents.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> cauſeth a writing to be preſented to the King in his own name, and the names of the other Heads of the League, wherein they demanded in ſubſtance: That he would unite himſelf tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with them, and ſincerely make himſelf Head of the League, to the extirpation of the <hi>Hugonots.</hi> That he ſhould put thoſe perſons from the Court, from his Counſels, and from their Offices, who ſhould be named by the Catholick Princes as ill-affected to Religion. That he
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95405:148"/> would make the Council of <hi>TRENT</hi> to be received and obſerved through the whole Kingdom, only excepting thoſe things which did prejudice the prviledge of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church. That he would grant ſome places which ſhould be thought fit, unto the confederate places for their ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, wherein they might keep Garriſons, and make neceſſary Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations at the expence of the Crown. That he would maintain an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my about the Confines of <hi>Lorain,</hi> under the Command of one of the Confederate Princes, to hinder the incurſions of Foreigners. That he would cauſe all the Eſtates of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> to be confiſcate and ſold, wherewith the expences of the late Wars might be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p>The end of the demand was only to make the King contemptible, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to favour the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> and furniſh the League with an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and pretence to take up Arms, and proſecute their begun deſigns, while the proſperity of their Fortune laſted. The burdens which the War, the maintaining of ſo many Armies, and his profuſe manner of ſpending, daily increaſed, had loſt the hearts of the people to the King. The noiſe of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi>'s Victories had obſcured the Majeſty of the King's name, his obſtinate favour to his Minions, had alienated the minds of his moſt ancient and devoted Servants: and the people of <hi>Paris</hi> ſwayed by the ambition of the Council of Sixteen in that City conſtituted by the <hi>Guiſians,</hi> could no longer endure Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The City was full of infamous Pamphlets, Politick Diſcourſes, Satyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Verſes, and Fabulous Stories, which for the moſt part abuſing the name of the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> redounded to the diſgrace of the King. On the other ſide every corner of <hi>Paris</hi> reſounded the praiſes of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> celebrated in Verſe and Proſe by many Writers, with the titles of the new <hi>David, the ſecond Moſes, the deliverer of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick People, the Prop and Pillar of the Holy Church.</hi> The Preachers filled the peoples ears with wonders of this new <hi>Gideon,</hi> come into the world for the deſired ſafety of the Kingdom. Which things ſpread from the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> diffuſed themſelves into all the Provinces, which received the ſame impreſſions, as well to the King's diſadvantage, as in favour of the League.</p>
               <p>The King declares the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> Admiral of the Kingdom, and Governour of <hi>Normandy,</hi> to the great diſcontent of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi> The Council of Sixteen informs the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> That they had twenty thouſand Armed men in the City at their devotion, ready to be put upon any enterprize. That they were divided into ſixteen Squadrons, to every one of which they had appointed a Commander, and that the reſt of the people would (doubtleſs) follow the ſtream of the Chief men.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:95405:149"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry,</hi> Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> was poiſoned at St. <hi>Jehan d'Angely</hi> by his own ſervants, and died, under whom the Proteſtants conceived great hopes: and his death raiſed the affliction of that party to the greateſt height.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> wrote to the Sixteen to leſſen their number, and reduce it but into five quarters, to which they ſhould appoint a place, where they ſhould meet at the ſign that ſhould be given, and that they ſhould diſpoſe things in ſuch a manner, as might breed neither diſorder nor confuſion. He ſent them five Commanders to order the five quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>viz.</hi> the Count of <hi>Briſac,</hi> the <hi>Sieur de Bois, Dauphin,</hi> the <hi>Sieur de Chamois,</hi> the <hi>Sieur d'Eſclavoles,</hi> and Colonel St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to whom the <hi>Sieur de Meneville</hi> was added, who had been a chief Inſtrument in that buſineſs. Theſe entred openly into <hi>Paris,</hi> under colour of private affairs, and being lodged in thoſe quarters of the City which were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them, frequented the Court, leaving the care to <hi>Meneville</hi> to bring the matter to its concluſion.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Aumale</hi> is in readineſs with five hundred Horſe to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Conſpiracy of the <hi>Pariſians.</hi> The Conſpirators reſolve to make uſe of the occaſion which the time of <hi>Lent</hi> would afford them, to ſeize on the King's Perſon then, when with the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> he ſhould be in Proceſſion as he was wont, in the habit of a Penitent among the whipping Friers, neither accompanied by his Guards, nor the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry retinue of the Court, and to ſhut him up with ſtrong Guards in a Monaſtery. After which the Duke of <hi>Aumale</hi>'s five hundred horſe and his other Forces ſhould preſently come in, and take poſſeſſion of the principall places, and keep them guarded till the arrival of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Nicholas Poulain,</hi> who was privy to all this Conſpiracy, reveals the whole Plot to the High Chancellour, and confirms it alſo to the King himſelf, who hereupon feigned himſelf not well, and ſo forbare to go to any ſpiritual exerciſe with the Fraternity of the Penitents. The King had no Forces ſufficient to bridle the <hi>Pariſians,</hi> whereupon the Queen ſaid in the <hi>Italian</hi> tongue, <hi>Biſogna copriſi bene il viſo inan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zi che ſtuzzicare il veſpaio.</hi> He that will ſtir up a Waſps neſt, had need to cover his face well; and then means would not be wanting to ſuppreſs the Conſpirators.</p>
               <p>But the King to make himſelf ſure of the Conſpiratours, blocks up the paſſages about <hi>Paris,</hi> to keep victuals from thence. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of ſixteen begin to ſuſpect, that their Plot is diſcovered, and the Heads being diſmayed ſend for the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> to <hi>Paris:</hi> the King ſends a command unto the Duke of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> not to come to <hi>Paris,</hi> but he comes to <hi>Paris</hi> at noon on <hi>May</hi> 9. 1588. followed only with eight Gentlemen. He lights at the Queen-Mother's Lodging, and goes with her to do his duty unto the King. The people follow him
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95405:149"/> by troops with great joy, crying, <hi>God ſave the Guiſe, God ſave the Pillar of the Church.</hi> He makes his reverence to the King, layes open the cauſes of his coming, juſtifies his actions as well as he could, and ſo withdraws till the King had dined. They meet both after dinner at the Queen-Mother's Lodging: the King full of fear and jealouſie, the Duke with a reſolute countenance. The next day the Archbiſhop of <hi>Lions</hi> (the chief Pillar of the League) arriveth: the Duke's friends and ſervants enter: The Sixteen bring and carry away ſundry intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences.</p>
               <p>The King commands the <hi>Marſhal de Byron</hi> to draw his Guards of <hi>Swiſſes</hi> and <hi>French</hi> out of the Suburbs into the City, and Lodgeth them in divers quarters. The people grow amazed; the chief of the League terrifie them with the apprehenſion of a ſpoil; they ſhut up their ſhops, and leaving their traffique betake themſelves to Arms.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pariſians</hi> raiſed at the Ringing of the Bells, make Barricado's croſs the Streets; and blocking up all the King's <hi>Corps de Garde,</hi> come up to the <hi>Louvre.</hi> The <hi>Swiſſes</hi> were preſently aſſaulted in St. <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi>'s Church-yard, where 36. of them being ſlain in the firſt onſet, the reſt yielded themſelves without reſiſtance, and with great violence were pillaged by the people. All the other Guards, of the <hi>Chaſtelet,</hi> the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Bridge, the Butchery, and the Town-houſe, were aſſaulted at the ſame time, the <hi>Swiſſes</hi> being in the ſame manner diſarmed, and made Priſoners at the peoples diſcretion. They made the <hi>French</hi> Guards to put out their matches, and lay down their Arms, and kept them in that manner till they had further order.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> ſeeing the City in his power, and the King (as it were) a Priſoner, ceaſeth to proſecute the forcing of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and appeaſeth the people, but gave order that the Barricado's ſhould be continued, That the people ſhould be every where in a readineſs with their Arms, that the Guards ſhould be kept with great care; expecting ſome body: ſhould come from the King (beſieged and ſtraitned) to make an overture of ſome agreement.</p>
               <p>The Queen-Mother goes to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> in her <hi>Sedan,</hi> being denied paſſage in her Coach, confers with him, but brings nothing but complaints and exorbitant demands. While the Queen-Mother returns to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and treats with him, the King with ſixteen Gentlemen leaves <hi>Paris,</hi> and retires to <hi>Chartres,</hi> where the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him with as much affection, as the <hi>Pariſians</hi> had done the Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi> The King at his departure from the <hi>Louvre</hi> (turning at <hi>Chaliot</hi> towards <hi>Paris</hi>) ſaid,<note place="margin">De Serres Hiſt. in vit. <hi>Henry</hi> III.</note> 
                  <hi>O diſloyal and ingrateful City, a City which I have alwaies honoured with my conſtant abode; which I have more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched than any of my Predeceſſours, I will never enter within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of thy Walls, but by the ruine of a great and memorable breach. Curſed likewiſe be you all, for whoſe content I have purchaſed the hatred of ſo many.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:95405:150"/>
               <p>The Duke being angry at the news of the King's ſudden departure, labours to ſecure his abſolute power in <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſeizeth on the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtille.</hi> The <hi>Capuchins</hi> are ſent in Proceſſion unto <hi>Chartres</hi> to mitigate the heat of his fury. The chief of the City alſo go to beſeech him to return to <hi>Paris.</hi> Seven demands are made by the League, <hi>viz.</hi> the extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hereſy by his Majeſties Forces, and the holy union: the baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> and of his Brother <hi>de la Valette;</hi> War in <hi>Guienne</hi> by the King in Perſon, and by the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> in <hi>Daulphiné,</hi> Abolition of the tumults of <hi>Paris:</hi> confirmation of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces choſen for Civil Cauſes ſince the Barricado's: a reſtoring of the goodly and ancient Ordinances of the Realm; and an abolition of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, gifts, and abuſes brought in by <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> and <hi>la Valette.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King determined to give outward ſatisfaction to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and the League, knowing that Peace would never be granted, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he conſented to remove from the Court the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon.</hi> Who coming to Court, being not received by the King with his wonted favour, quits his Government in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and retires to <hi>Angoleſme,</hi> where by a Conſpiracy of the Citizens his life is in great danger. He was accompanied by the Abbot <hi>del Bene,</hi> who was no leſs perſecuted by the League than He. This retreat removed all impediments that might have hindered Peace.</p>
               <p>Now the concluſion of the Peace was eaſie: for on the one ſide the King granted all that the League asked for, or pretended to. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Peace, were almoſt the ſame that were contained in the writing framed at <hi>Nancy,</hi> with the privity of the Duke of <hi>Lorain,</hi> which had been preſented to the King in the beginning of the year. That the King ſhould again declare himſelf Head of the Catholick League: he promiſeth never to make a Peace nor Truce with the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> nor any Edict in their favour. He ſhall by a publick Edict oblige all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Peers of <hi>France,</hi> Lords and Officers of the Crown, Towns, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, Corporations, and the whole people to ſwear the ſame: and bind themſelves with a ſolemn Oath never to ſuffer any one to reign, that was not of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion: and that for time to come none ſhould be admitted to Offices, Places and Dignities in any part of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but ſuch as were Catholicks, and made profeſſion of their Faith according to the Doctrine of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> and the Belief of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> That the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſhould be received and obſerved through the whole Kingdom, upon the conditions and exceptions for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned; the priviledges of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church being within three Months to be declared by a Congregation of Prelates, and the King's Council, with divers other Articles.</p>
               <p>The Articles concluded and confirmed, the King preſently ſent forth his Letters Patents into all Provinces; and ſeveral Bailages, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the Aſſembly of the States in <hi>October</hi> following at <hi>Blois,</hi> a place

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> goeth with the Queen-Mother to <hi>Chartres</hi> unto the King, and is received by him with great demonſtrations of honour in appearance. The King cauſeth the Edict of the <hi>union</hi> to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in his Council, and ſworn to by every one; and the War againſt the <hi>Hugonots</hi> to be openly Proclaimed; for the proſecution whereof two ſeveral Armies were appointed: one in <hi>Dauphiné</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Duke of <hi>Mayenne;</hi> the other in <hi>Poictou,</hi> under <hi>Ludovico Gonzaga</hi> Duke of <hi>Nevers.</hi> The King gives the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> the General Command over all the men at Arms, of the Realm. This (though not the name and title, yet) in effect was the Office and charge of <hi>Conſtable.</hi> He makes the Cardinal of <hi>Guiſe</hi> Legate of <hi>Avignon,</hi> the which he promiſeth to obtain for him of the Pope.

               <p>The King begins the Aſſembly with an elegant Oration; wherein atteſting the earneſt deſires of the good of his people, and ſhewing the dangerous condition wherein inteſtine diſcords had involved the Crown, he exhorted every one to lay aſide their paſſions, to forget their enmities, to reunite themſelves ſincerely under his obedience, forſaking all novelties, condemning all Leagues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed both him their Lawful Sovereign, and the peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. For as he pardoned all that was paſt, ſo for the time to come he would not endure it, but account it as an Act of abſolute Treaſon. That as he reſolved to perſecute and tread down Hereſie, to favour thoſe that were good, to reſtore the ſplendour and force of juſtice, to advance Religion, to uphold the Nobility, and to disburden the Common people; ſo he earneſtly prayed and conjured every one of them to aſſiſt him with their good Counſels and ſincere inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>This ſpeech of the King's ſtung the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> to the quick, and all thoſe of his party. He cauſed his Speech to be Printed, which ſerved much to excuſe thoſe things which followed afterward. After the King's Speech followed the Oration of <hi>Monthelon,</hi> who proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes and amplifies the King's Speech. To which the Archbiſhop of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> anſwered for the Order of the Clergy, the Baron <hi>de Seneſchay,</hi> for the Nobility, and the <hi>Prevoſt des Merchands</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> for the third Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Commons. The <hi>Tueſday</hi> following, the King and the States ſwear in ſolemn manner to perform the Edict made before of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Bourges</hi> ſhewed the States the greatneſs and obligation of the Oath which they were to take. <hi>Beaulieu,</hi> the new Secretary of State, inrolled an Act of that Oath, in memory of ſo ſolemn an Action. After it was done, they gave thanks to God publickly in the Church of S. <hi>Saveur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Propoſition of receiving the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> made in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the States, is generally rejected. The King is requeſted to declare the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> incapable of the Crown, and all others ſuſpected to be <hi>Hugonots:</hi> and after much oppoſition he coldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents unto it, and gives unto the Deputies a Proteſtation which had been preſented unto him from the King of <hi>Navarre:</hi> who, having called a Congregation of thoſe of his party at <hi>Rochel,</hi> had cauſed a writing to be printed, wherein he demanded the execution of thoſe Edicts and Grants which had been ſo often made to thoſe of his party: the Convocation of a National or univerſal Council, wherein he might lawfully be inſtructed in thoſe things that were controverted in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Faith: and finally, he proteſted to count invalid whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhould be determined againſt him in that Aſſembly at <hi>Blois.</hi> To which Propoſitions of the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King added, That if juſtice requires, no man ſhould be ſentenced or condemned
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95405:151"/> without being ſummoned, or without hearing his defence; it was not good to Decree ſo heavy a ſentence, without giving him warning to anſwer for himſelf, and without hearing his reaſons whatſoever they were.</p>
               <p>The King ſeeing the obſtinacy of the States, and their reſolution againſt the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> procures an abſolution at <hi>Rome</hi> for the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> and Count <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> which much troubleth the Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King being no longer able to bear the inſolencies of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> reſolves upon his deſtruction: and to bring the matter the better to paſs, (ſeeming (as it were) to be ſtirred by devotion) determined to remove to a Cell, meaning there to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, and receive the Sacrament. He called into his Chamber four of his Council, ſuch as he beſt truſted, to whom he diſcovered the injuries and indignities he had received of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme ambition; the danger himſelf ſtood in by the Treaſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually practiſed by the ſaid Duke and his Confederates againſt his Perſon. He told them he was determined to have the Duke ſlain as a Traytour, which was conſented to. The evening of the 22. day of <hi>December</hi> being come, the King commanded <hi>Monſieur de Larchant,</hi> one of the Captains of his Guard, to double them the next morning, and to keep the Hall door, after the Lords of the Council were gone in; but that he ſhould do it in ſuch a manner, as the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> might not ſuſpect any thing, which was done.</p>
               <p>In the morning the King made himſelf ready before day,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Davil</hi> Hiſt. of the Civil Wars of <hi>France l.</hi> 9.</note> under colour of going Perſonally to the Council, and pretending he ſhould ſtay there many hours, diſmiſſed all his Servants: and in his cloſet there only remained <hi>Revol</hi> Secretary of State, Colonel <hi>Alfonſo Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,</hi> and <hi>Monſieur de la Baſtide,</hi> a <hi>Gaſcon,</hi> who were all command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him to ſtay there. In his Chamber was St. <hi>Pris,</hi> one of his old Gentlemen-waiters; in the Wardrobe the Count <hi>de Termes,</hi> Great Chamberlain, and in the Anti-chamber two Pages, an Uſher that waited at the Council-chamber-door, and <hi>Lognac,</hi> with eight of the five and fourty, to whom the King had with very great Promiſes ſignified his pleaſure, and found them moſt ready to obey his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. At break of day the Counſellours met, and went into the Great Hall.</p>
               <p>The Duke being come into the Council, ſitting near the fire, fell into a little ſwound, but quickly recovered. Secretary <hi>Revol</hi> came into the Council out of the Anti-chamber, and told him the King would have him to come unto him in the Cloſet. The Duke aroſe, and entred into the Anti-chamber, which preſently being locked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, he ſaw there only eight Gentlemen of the King's Guard which were well known unto him: and as he went from thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cloſet, he ſtretcht forth his hand to lift up the hanging of the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95405:152"/> door: but at that inſtand S. <hi>Malin,</hi> one of the eight, ſtabbed him into the neck with a Dagger,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> Slain.</note> and the reſt preſently fell upon him on every ſide: and after many wounds given him in the head, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at laſt ſtruck by <hi>Lognac</hi> (upon whom he had moſt violently thrown hlmſelf) he fell down at the door of the Wardrobe, and there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired. The Cardinal of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and Archbiſhop of <hi>Lions</hi> are made Priſoners, as alſo all the Lords, and other chief adherents of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> with <hi>Anne d'Eſte,</hi> Ducheſs of <hi>Nemours,</hi> and Mother to the <hi>Guiſes. Pelicart,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi>'s Secretary, was likewiſe taken, with all the writings which belonged to his Lord: among which they found many Letters, containing divers pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices within and without the Kingdom, the accounts of money which he had received from <hi>Spain,</hi> to the ſumm of two millions of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats. Many whom the King deſired to get into his hands, eſcaped the fury of that preſent revenge. The body of the dead Duke being laid up in a green cloth, was carried by the door-keepers into the great room beyond the King's Cloſet, and there laid till further order.</p>
               <p>Then the King ſent <hi>Revol</hi> to the Cardinal-Legate to give him notice of all that had paſſed, and to entreat him to meet him at Maſs, ſhewing how great a deſire he had to be excuſed to the Pope. Then having cauſed the doors to be opened and every one to be admitted into his Chamber, he ſaid with a loud voice, That from thence-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he would have his Subjects learn to know and obey him, that every one therefore from that time ſhould forget ſtubbornneſs and Rebellion: for he would be a King not only in words but in deeds alſo. So with an angry look, and ſowr countenance, he went down the ſtairs into his Mothers Lodgings.</p>
               <p>The Queen having been ill, lay in her bed when the King came unto her, to whom the King ſaid, This morning I have made my ſelf King of <hi>France,</hi> having put to death the King of <hi>Paris.</hi> The Queen replyed: You have made the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> to be ſlain, but God grant you be not now made King of nothing. Have you foreſeen the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs that are like to follow? Two things are neceſſary, <hi>Speed</hi> and <hi>Reſolution.</hi> So being much afflicted in mind and with the Gout, ſhe held her peace. And the King went to meet the Legate, that they might go to Maſs together; and before Maſs the King diſcourſeth long with the Cardinal of <hi>Moreſini</hi> about the Duke of <hi>Guiſes</hi> death. The King ſeeing that the Legate ſhewed no trouble at the impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Cardinals, Commandeth that <hi>Lewes</hi> of <hi>Lorain,</hi> Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> be alſo put to death. And <hi>Du-Gaſt,</hi> Captain of the King's Guard cauſeth the Cardinal of <hi>Guiſe</hi> to be ſlain by four Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers Armed with <hi>Partezans.</hi> His body was carried to the ſame place where the body of the Duke his Brother lay. The King doubted,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95405:152"/> that if their bodies were ſeen, they might occaſion ſome tumult: and therefore having by the Counſel of his Phyſitian cauſed them to be buried in quick-lime, within a few hours all their fleſh was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, and afterwards the bones were ſecretly interred in an unknown place.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> eſcaped out of Priſon on the fourth day. And <hi>Anne d'Eſte,</hi> Mother to him and the dead Princes of <hi>Lorain,</hi> was alſo voluntarily freed by the King, and divers others were ſet at liberty. The Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Janville</hi> (now Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi>) the Archbiſhop of <hi>Lions,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Elbeuf,</hi> are all put into the Caſtle of <hi>Amboyſe.</hi> The Archbiſhop of <hi>Lions</hi> being often examined, would never anſwer, alledging that as Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of all <hi>France,</hi> he had no other Superiour but the Apoſtolick See.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> third Brother to the <hi>Guiſes,</hi> being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed of the death of his Brothers, flees from <hi>Lions,</hi> unto <hi>Dijon,</hi> a place under his Government. In his valour and wiſdom all the foundations and hopes of the League were now reduced. The Queen-Mother died on <hi>January</hi> 5. 1589. in the ſeventieth year of her age.</p>
               <p>After the death of the Duke and Cardinal of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> the City of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi> took Arms, ſuppreſſed the King's Magiſtrates, and aſſaulted the Fortreſs. The Citizens of <hi>Chartres</hi> did the ſame, though in the late commotions it had been of the King's party.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Paris,</hi> the Council of the League being come together in the midſt of the City full of tumults, reſolved to ſend for <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Aumale,</hi> who flying from the States at <hi>Bloys,</hi> out of a certain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaging fear, had ſtayed in <hi>Paris,</hi> and that very day was retired to his devotions to the Covent of <hi>Carthuſians</hi> hard by the City; at whoſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival all the multitude ran to his houſe, though late at night, ſpending the time only in lamentations.</p>
               <p>The next day the whole City being in grief, they diſpatched di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſervice quickly, and from the Churches being come to the Town-houſe, the ſame Council met again there, at which were preſent the moſt noted Citizens, and many alſo of the Magiſtrates; ſome drawn by an anxious curioſity; ſome driven by the fear of being torn in pieces by the fury of the multitude; and ſome came to find reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy againſt the unbridled raſhneſs of the common people. But it was all in vain. <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Lorain,</hi> Duke of <hi>Aumaele,</hi> being made Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Paris</hi> by the City, Arms the people, and orders them regularly under Commanders. The Preacher from their Pulpits trumpet out the praiſes of the Duke of <hi>Guiſes</hi> Martyrdom, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations of that ſlaughter committed by the King. Upon <hi>December</hi> 28. the Council of Sixteen cauſed a writing to be preſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95405:153"/> Colledge of Divines, called the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> in the name of the Provoſt and <hi>Eſchuins</hi> of the City, wherein relating how much the Lords of <hi>Guiſe</hi> deſerved of the Catholique Church, and their being murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the King as Protectors of the Faith, They demanded whether he might not Lawfully be ſaid to have forfeited his Crown, and whether it were not Lawful for his Subjects (notwithſtanding their Oath of Allegiance) to withdraw their obedience from him, as a Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the holy Church, who had embrued his hands in the blood of a Sacred Cardinal.</p>
               <p>The Colledge of <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> declares <hi>Henry</hi> III. to have forfeited his Right to the Crown, and his Subjects free from their Oath of Allegiance. The Kings Arms and Statues are thrown down; the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varriſts</hi> and <hi>Politicks</hi> are ſlain: many quiet men left their houſes in thoſe tumults to ſave their lives. All the Streets were full of Arms, noiſes, and confuſions, and the meaneſt people raging againſt the marks of Royalty, committed intolerable inſolencies. The Preachers aggravated the Parricide committed by the King, and all places were full of Libels both in Verſe and Proſe, which contained and amplified the ſame things ſeveral waies.</p>
               <p>By the advice of the Council of Sixteen all the Counſellours of Parliament and Officers who adhered to the King, are impriſoned in the <hi>Baſtille.</hi> And the Parliament being afterward aſſembled to the number of 160. they with a Publick Declaration aſſented to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the King, and to the freeing of the City, and ſubſtituted new men in the places of thoſe whom they had put out and impriſoned. They alſo made a Decree to unite and combine themſelves for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Religion, calling that League <hi>the Holy union.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the inſurrection of the Parliament and City of <hi>Paris,</hi> the greateſt Cities and moſt Warlike People of <hi>France,</hi> took Arms likewiſe, and made a General Commotion; ſo that the party of the League was not only grown very great by the conjunction of the principal Cities, but was alſo ſtrengthened by the abetting of the Nobility, in whom for the moſt part the Forces of that Crown conſiſt.</p>
               <p>All the Provinces of the Kingdom were divided and diſmembred, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were againſt Cities, Caſtles againſt Caſtles, Lords, Gentlemen, and meaner perſons againſt one another: the Laws were trodden down, the bond of common Charity broken, the Magiſtrates dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven away from all places, and a moſt cruel Civil War with fire, ſlaughter, blood, and rapine, was begun, ſo that all commerce being broken off, the waies beſet, the Gentry and Commons Armed, and even the very Clergy incompaſſed with Guards and weapons, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times under the names of <hi>Hugonots</hi> and Catholicks,<note place="margin">

               <p>The King diſſolved the Aſſembly at <hi>Bloys,</hi> but many of the Lords, as ſoon as they were departed from <hi>Bloys,</hi> joyned again to the party of the League. Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. being told of the Cardinal of <hi>Guiſe</hi>'s death, is highly offended, and anſwereth the King's Ambaſſadours very ſharply, who come to excuſe it to him, and chuſeth a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Cardinals, who were to conſult about the affairs of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King writes kind Letters to the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> promiſing him very great things: but the ſaid Duke (notwithſtanding the King's promiſes) being perſwaded by <hi>Madam de Montpenſier,</hi> his Siſter, makes himſelf Head of the holy union, and gave order to the <hi>Sieurs de Rhoſne, de S. Paul, Chamois,</hi> and <hi>d'Eſchavoles,</hi> to recruit their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of <hi>French</hi> foot, and began to ſummon the Nobility and Gentry his dependents, and to win the hearts of the people in every place. On <hi>February</hi> 15. the Duke came to <hi>Paris</hi> with 4000. Souldiers, and 500. Gentlemen; there he is declared Lieutenant General of the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> On <hi>February</hi> 22. the Duke took poſſeſſion in the Parliament of his extraordinary dignity, having taken a publick Oath for the defence of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion againſt every one, to preſerve entire the State belonging to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> to defend the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the three Orders, the Clergy, Nobility, and Commons, and to cauſe the Laws and Conſtitutions of the Kingdom to be obſerved, as alſo the authority and power of the Parliaments. After which Oath many Prayers and Proceſſions having been made, he choſe and appointed the Council of the Union, conſiſting of forty of the moſt eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the League, which with his aſſiſtance, was to treat of, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all the moſt weighty affairs; the Council of Sixteen being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs left, and particularly appointed for the ſpecial Government of <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Duke of his Forces began to form an Army, and in every Province he allotted both Forces and Commanders to order the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the League, and to make war againſt thoſe who were of the King's party. He diſpatcheth Miniſters to <hi>Rome</hi> to confirm the Pope's inclination, who afterward publiſheth a Monitory againſt the King of <hi>France,</hi> and foments the League exceedingly.</p>
               <p>The King being neceſſitated to make War, agreeth with the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and concludes a Truce with him. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour leaveth the Court, and goeth to reſide in <hi>Paris</hi> with the Heads of the League. The Pope's Legate departeth alſo, and not having been able to perſwade the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> to conſent to Peace, goes out of the Kingdom. The War begins furiouſly in every place. The
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95405:154"/> King of <hi>Navarre</hi> grants Liberty of Conſcience in thoſe places he had taken, and publiſheth a <hi>Manifeſto,</hi> offering to take Arms againſt thoſe that rebelled againſt their natural King. The Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> after the death of the <hi>Guiſes</hi> returned to his former greatneſs with the King. Captain <hi>Du-Gaſt,</hi> who killed the Cardinal of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> treats about an accord with thoſe of the League by the perſwaſion of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Lions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Truce was concluded by the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Navarre</hi> upon theſe Conditions. That the publick exerciſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſhould be reſtored in all places held by the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> without any exception. That the goods of the Clergy ſhould be reſtored to them, whereſoever they were, and that all Priſoners which were in their hands ſhould be ſet at liberty. That the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> ſhould be obliged to ſerve the King Perſonally with 4000. Foot, and 1200. Horſe, whereſoever he ſhould be Commanded; and that all the Cities, Towns and places of his party ſhould obſerve the Laws and Conſtitutions of the Kingdom, obey the Parliament and the King's Magiſtrates; and on the other ſide that the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> ſhould receive the City of <hi>Saumur,</hi> and keep it in his power, to have a Paſs over the River <hi>Loire;</hi> which yet he would be obliged to reſtore at the King's pleaſure without any contradiction. Which Capitulations after they were agreed upon and ratified, <hi>Beaulieu</hi> the Secretary of State delivered up <hi>Saumur</hi> to the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who gave the Government thereof to <hi>Sieur du Pleſſis Mornay,</hi> his old Confident. The ſame truce was made in <hi>Dauphiné</hi> between Colonel <hi>Alfonſo Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi> on the King's part, and <hi>Monſieur de leſdiguiers,</hi> for the King of <hi>Navarre;</hi> and they united their Forces for their common defence. The Proteſtants rejoyced exceedingly at this reconciliation, magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying their Faith and Obedience toward the King, to the confuſion of thoſe who till then had publiſhed and defamed them as tumultuous and diſobedient Rebels.</p>
               <p>The King receives an aid of mony from the Great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and ſends to the <hi>Swiſſes</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> to aſſiſt him with Forces both of Horſe and Foot. He calleth all the Preſidents and Counſellours of the Parliaments of <hi>Paris, Roven,</hi> and <hi>Dijon,</hi> who were fled from the popular fury, reſolving that the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> ſhould reſide in <hi>Tours,</hi> that of <hi>Roven</hi> in <hi>Caen,</hi> in the ſame Province of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and that of <hi>Dijon</hi> at <hi>Chalons,</hi> and then by a ſharp Edict declared them all Rebels, who being choſen to the dignity of the Parliaments, ſhould continue to reſide in thoſe Cities and places which had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn themſelves from his obedience, and forbad all men to have any recourſe to them to ſeek for juſtice, declaring all ſentences to be void, which they ſhould pronounce under the name and title of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. The ſame declaration he made againſt the Duke of <hi>Mayen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:95405:154"/> againſt the Duke of <hi>Aumale,</hi> and others. Then having appointed Governours in all Provinces he gave Commiſſion to make Levies, to draw Souldiers together, and that the War ſhould be begun in every place.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pariſians</hi> at the news of the Truce between the King and the Proteſtants, beſides many publick ſigns of contempt, forbid the King to be prayed for any longer in the Canon of the Maſs.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Montpenſier</hi> begins the War againſt thoſe of the League, defeateth the <hi>Gautiers</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and the Count of <hi>Briſac</hi>'s Forces, who came to divert the ſiege of <hi>Falais.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> takes <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Brienne</hi> Priſoner. An interview was had between the <hi>French</hi> King and the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> at the <hi>Parc du Pleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> without the Walls of <hi>Tours. Mayenne</hi> aſſaults the King's Army at <hi>Tours,</hi> where they fight a long time. The King himſelf orders and diſpoſeth his Souldiers, puts himſelf among thoſe that fight. But Supplies coming from the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> he gives off the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Aumale</hi> beſiegeth <hi>Senlis: Monſieur de Longueville</hi> goes with ſmall Forces to relieve it, and raiſeth the ſiege with a great ſlaughter of the Leaguers. <hi>Aumale</hi> fighteth, and loſeth the day with his Artillery, Baggage, and thirty Colours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monſieur de Sancy</hi> having raiſed great Forces in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and begun the War with <hi>Savoy,</hi> marcheth towards <hi>Paris</hi> againſt the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers, whither the King was alſo advancing. But the Count <hi>de Soiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> being aſſaulted by the Duke <hi>de Mercoeur,</hi> is taken Priſoner. The <hi>Sieur de Saveuſe</hi> going with 400. Horſe to joyn with <hi>Mayenne,</hi> is routed by the <hi>Sieur de Chaſtillon,</hi> and taken Priſoner.</p>
               <p>The King takes <hi>Gergeau</hi> and <hi>Piviers.</hi> But <hi>Chartres</hi> ſet open their Gates; and having driven out the dependents of the League, received the King with all his Army.</p>
               <p>The Pope by Monitory declares the King liable to cenſure, if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſixty daies he releaſes not the Prelates, and doth not penance for the Cardinal of <hi>Guiſes</hi> death. The King being troubled at it faſteth forty hours: he ſaid, he thought it hard, that he who had ever fought and laboured for Religion, ſhould be raſhly Excommunicated, becauſe he would not ſuffer his own throat to be cut by the Arms of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Subjects: and that thoſe who had ſacked <hi>Rome,</hi> and kept the Pope himſelf Priſoner, had never been Excommunicated. The King of <hi>Navarre</hi> being preſent anſwered: But they were Victorious: Let your Majeſty endeavour to Conquer, and aſſuredly the cenſures ſhall be revoked; but if we be overcome, we ſhall all die condemned Hereticks.</p>
               <p>The King taking <hi>Eſtampes,</hi> hangs the Magiſtrates, and gives the pillage of the Town to the Souldiers. <hi>Montereau</hi> was alſo taken by
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95405:155"/> Storm, and ſacked. <hi>Poiſſy</hi> yielded it ſelf, and now the King was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of that ſpacious Bridge, which there gives paſſage over the <hi>Seine.</hi> Here <hi>Montpenſier</hi> joyned with the King's Army. <hi>Pointoiſe</hi> was after a bloody aſſault alſo forced to yield. The next day the forreign Army arrived at <hi>Poiſſy</hi>-bridge, there the <hi>Swiſſes</hi> joyn with t e King. All the Bridges being loſt, all the neighbouring Towns ſurrendered, all the paſſages of the River ſtopped and the City ſtraitned on all ſides, there was no other hope left but what the preſence of the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> and of the Army afforded, which was all ſhut up within the Circuit of the Suburbs of <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The City of <hi>Paris</hi> being much ſtraitned and under great terrour (a thing well known to the King by the frequency of thoſe who ran every hour from the City to his Camp) upon the laſt day of <hi>July</hi> he would needs Perſonally view the Enemies Poſts, reſolving on the 2. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> to aſſault their works on every ſide. In his return toward S. <hi>Cloud</hi> ſtopping his Horſe upon an hill, from whence he ſaw all the City diſtinctly, he brake forth into theſe words. <hi>O Paris, thou art the head of the Kingdom, but an Head too great, and too Capricious; it is neceſſary by letting blood to cure thee again.

                     </gap> hope that within few daies here ſhall be neither walls nor houſes, but only the very footſteps of</hi> Paris.</p>
               <p>But now there was in <hi>Paris</hi> one <hi>Jaques Clement,</hi> a Frier of the Order of S. <hi>Dominick,</hi> born of mean Parents in a Village called <hi>Sorbone,</hi> in the Territory of the City of <hi>Sens,</hi> a young man about twenty two years of age, and alwaies thought by his fellow-Friers, and others that knew him, to be an half-witted fellow, and rather a ſubject of ſport, than to be feared. This fellow reſolves to hazard his life to kill the King, whom he called by the name of Tyrant, and to free that holy City (as he ſaid) from <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> violence: with which reſolution he went to Doctor <hi>Burgoine</hi> Prior of his Covent, and imparted this dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable project to him; to Father <hi>Commolet,</hi> to other Jeſuites, and to the Heads of the League, all of them encouraging him to this deviliſh deſign, with promiſe of Abbeys and Biſhopricks if he eſcaped, and if he died in the action to be made a Martyr, and have place in heaven above the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>To that end he goes from <hi>Paris</hi> having gotten a letter of credit from the Count of <hi>Brienne,</hi> who having been taken at S. <hi>Ovyn,</hi> was ſtill Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner in the City, aſſuring him, that he was to ſpeak with the King about a buſineſs of infinite importance. Upon the firſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> in the morning, the Frier being brought in to the King, gives him the letter from the <hi>Count de Brienne,</hi> which the King read: and having bid him proceed to tell his buſineſs, he feigned to feel for another paper to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it: and whilſt the King ſtood intentively expecting it, he having drawn his knife out of his ſleeve, ſtruck him on the left ſide of the navel,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95405:155"/> and left all the blade buried in the wound. The King feeling the blow,<note place="margin">King <hi>Henry</hi> III. is killed by <hi>James Clement</hi> a Frier.</note> drew forth the knife, and in drawing of it made the wound wider, and preſently ſtruck it himſelf up to the haft in the Frier's forehead, who at the ſame time (<hi>la Gueſle</hi> running him thorow with his ſword) fell down dead: and was no ſooner fallen, but <hi>Momperat, Lognac,</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>de Mirepoix,</hi> Gentlemen of the King's Chamber, who were preſent at the fact, threw him out of the window, where by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers he was torn in pieces, burnt, and his aſhes thrown into the River. The King was carried to his bed, and ſending for the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> he committed to him the care of the Army. He told him, it cuſtom of killing Kings ſhould grow in uſe, neither ſhould he be long ſecure. He exhorted the Nobility to acknowledge the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> to whom the Kingdom of right belonged. His Confeſſour abſolved him and gave him the Sacrament the ſame night. And having embraced the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> having called his Chaplain, he in the preſence of them all rehearſed the Creed after the uſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: and having croſſed himſelf, began the <hi>Miſerere,</hi> but his ſpeech failing him in theſe words, <hi>Redde mihi laetitiam ſalutis tuae,</hi> he died, having lived 36. years, and Reigned 15. and juſt 2. Months. In his death ended the Line of Kings of the houſe of <hi>Valois,</hi> and the poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Philip</hi> III. Sirnamed <hi>the Hardy;</hi> and by vertue of the Salique Law the Crown devolved to the Family of <hi>Bourbon</hi> neareſt of the blood, and deſcended from <hi>Robert</hi> Count of <hi>Clermont,</hi> the ſecond Son of St. <hi>Lewes.</hi>

               <p>Here let the Reader be advertiſed, that when the Jeſuites have made choice of an Inſtrument for that King-killing ſervice, that they intend to ſet him about; they do not put him upon it till they have firſt raiſed and fitted his ſpirit for the ſervice by this means. Firſt they bring him to a very private place in a Chappel, or Oratory, where the knife lies wrapt up in a cloth with an Ivory ſheath, with divers Characters, and <hi>Agnus Dei</hi>'s upon it. They draw the knife, and bedew it with holy water, and hang upon the haft of it ſome Beads conſecrated, with this Indulgence, that ſo many blows as he gives in killing the King, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſouls ſhall he deliver out of Purgatory. Then they give the knife to him, commending it to him in theſe words, <hi>O thou choſen Son of God, take to thee the Sword of</hi> Jephte, Sampſon, David, Gideon, Judith, <hi>of</hi> Macchabees, <hi>of</hi> Julius <hi>the ſecond, who defended himſelf from the Princes by his ſword. Go, and be wiſely couragious, and God ſtrengthen thy hand.</hi> Then they all fall upon their knees with this prayer: <hi>Be preſent, O ye Cherubims and Seraphims, be preſent ye Thrones, Powers, holy Angels fill this Veſſel with glory, give him the Crown of all the holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs; he is no longer ours but your companion. And thou, O God, ſtrengthen his arm, that he may do thy will, give him thy helmet, and wings to flie from his enemies, give him thy comforting beams, which
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95405:156"/> may joy him in the midſt of his ſorrows.</hi> Then they bring him to the Altar, where is the Picture of <hi>Jaques Clement,</hi> who killed King <hi>Henry</hi> III. the Angels protecting him, and then they ſhew him a Crown of glory, and ſay, <hi>Lord reſpect this thy arm and Executioner of thy ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</hi> Then four Jeſuites are appointed privately to talk with him, they tell him, that they ſee a Divine luſtre in his face, which moves them to fall down and kiſs his feet; and now (ſay they) he is no more a mortal man. They envy his happineſs, every one ſighing, and ſaying, Would God I were in your room, that they might eſcape Purgatory, and go immediately into Paradiſe. But if they perceive him to ſhrink, and to be troubled, after all this they will ſometimes affright him with terrible apparitions in the night; and ſometimes have the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and the Angels appear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Navarre</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Henry</hi> III. in the Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> (not daring to take upon him the title of King) cauſed it by publick Proclamation to be given to <hi>Charles</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> then a Priſoner, and coined both Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with the Picture of King <hi>Charles</hi> X. And diſguiſing the uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his authority, he accepted the title which the General Council of the union gave him, <hi>of Lieutenant General of the State, and Crown of</hi> France.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Luxemburg</hi> told the new King, that the Princes, Lords, and Officers of the Crown, together with the Catholick Nobility that was in the Army, were ready to acknowledge him King of <hi>France,</hi> to ſerve him againſt every one, ſince God and nature had called him to the Crown by a lawful ſucceſſion: but withal they beſought him he would be pleaſed to turn to the Catholick Religion, to take away the pretences of his enemies, and the ſcruples of his ſervants.</p>
               <p>The King gives them thanks, telling them how ready he was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite their duty and fidelity, both in publick and in particular; but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired they would not think it ſtrange, if he did not ſo preſently ſatisfie their firſt requeſts, becauſe the quality of the thing demanded, required a convenient time of advice, and the ripeneſs of a grounded reſolution. That he ſet a greater value upon his Soul and Conſcience than upon all earthly greatneſs. That he had been bred in the Reformed Religion, but nevertheleſs he would not be obſtinate. That he was ready to ſubmit himſelf either to a General or National Council, and to the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which without palliating the truth, ſhould be given him by learned
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95405:156"/> conſcientious perſons. That he had a firm reſolution to endeavour the ſatisfaction of his Subjects; but that conjuncture was not proper to put his good deſires in effect, leſt his action and declaration ſhould ſeem feigned, and extorted by force, or elſe perſwaded by worldly intereſts. Wherefore he intreated them to ſtay till a fit opportunity; and if in the mean time they deſired any condition or ſecurity for the maintenance of the Catholick Religion, he was ready to give them all the ſatisfaction they could wiſh for.</p>
               <p>After their departure the <hi>Sieur de la Nove,</hi> a Proteſtant, tells the King, he muſt never think to be King of <hi>France</hi> if he turn not Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick.</p>
               <p>At laſt it was concluded, that the King taking a prefixed time for his turning to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, he ſhould ſecure the State of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion, and that upon thoſe terms they would receive and follow him. And at laſt a writing was mutually agreed on between both Parties, whereby the Popiſh Princes, Lords, and Officers of the Crown, Nobility and Souldiery on the one ſide, ſwear fidelity to the King; and on the other ſide the King ſwears to the maintenance of the Popiſh Religion. The Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> ſtanding upon precedency, will not ſign the writing, but departs from Court. Many Lords, and a great part of the Souldiers, following the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi>'s exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, leave the Camp, ſo that in few daies the Army is decreaſed to half the number. Many of the Proteſtants alſo disbanded out of anger and diſcontent, and returned in great abundance to the Cities of their party.</p>
               <p>The King raiſeth the ſiege from <hi>Paris,</hi> and divides his Forces into convenient places. The Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon</hi> is taken out of <hi>Chinon,</hi> and removed to <hi>Fontenay,</hi> a ſtronger place, where he is kept with ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter Guards.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Luxembourg</hi> is ſent Ambaſſadour to the Pope by the Catholick Royalliſts: and the King appoints the Aſſembly at <hi>Tours,</hi> which is made the Head-quarter of his party. The body of King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> III. is laid in the great Church of <hi>Compeign,</hi> with very little Pomp, and ſuch as the neceſſity of the times, would permit by King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. who went towards <hi>Normandy</hi> with all poſſible ſpeed. The King's Army is reduced to but 6000. Foot, and 1400. Horſe, yet he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth with good ſucceſs as far as <hi>Diepe,</hi> where he fortifies his quarters, poſſeſſing all places of advantage.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> being come before the King's trenches, draws his Army in <hi>Battalia;</hi> but the King's Souldiers coming only to skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, no Battel followeth. They that were in the League making ſigns of coming over to the King's party, are received by them at the <hi>Maladery,</hi> but being entred in an hoſtile manner fall upon them that had brought them in, and make themſelves maſters of the place: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95405:157"/> both Armies joyn Battel, and the King being relieved by <hi>Monſieur de Chaſtillon,</hi> recovereth the trenches, and the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth from <hi>Diepe</hi> with his Army.</p>
               <p>The King came to <hi>Amiens,</hi> the chief City of <hi>Picardy,</hi> where he was entertained with very great pomp, being met without the Gates by all the Citizens, who preſented unto him a Canopy of State to be carried over him, as the cuſtom is to do unto the King, but he refuſed it, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving great teſtimony of his prudence and moderation by an act of ſo great modeſty.</p>
               <p>Whilſt he ſtayed at <hi>Amiens, Elizabeth</hi> Queen of <hi>England,</hi> firſt ſent him twenty thouſand pounds Sterling, with Powder, Munition for War, and certain Ships alſo to ſerve at his command: and cauſing a general Muſter to be taken in moſt of the Shires of <hi>England,</hi> ſhe ſent 4000. <hi>Engliſh</hi> Souldiers, and 1000. <hi>Scots</hi> very well appointed, and furniſhed. All the money he preſently diſtributed among his Souldiers. The General of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> was the Noble <hi>Peregrine Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> Lord <hi>Willoughby,</hi> which Forces were again recruited with a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of three thouſand Foot, which were ſent into <hi>Britany,</hi> under the Conduct of that Son of <hi>Mors,</hi> Sir <hi>John Norris.</hi> Theſe joyning with the Prince of <hi>Dombes,</hi> General of that Province, did many worthy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits for the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>
               <p>The King now marcheth towards <hi>Paris,</hi> having in his Army 20000. Foot, 3000. Horſe, and fourteen great Pieces. He aſſaults the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs of <hi>Paris</hi> upon <hi>All-Saints-day,</hi> and taking them gives the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage to the Souldiers. In the aſſault above 900. <hi>Pariſians</hi> were ſlain, and more than 400. taken Priſoners, among which Father <hi>Edmond Burgoine,</hi> Prior of the Covent of <hi>Jacobins,</hi> who being convicted by witneſs to have publickly in the Pulpit praiſed the Murder of <hi>Henry</hi> III. and to have counſelled and inſtigated the murderer, comparing him alſo in his Sermons after the fact to <hi>Judith,</hi> and the dead King to <hi>

               <p>But at the arrival of the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> the King leaves the Suburbs of <hi>Paris,</hi> and coming to <hi>Eſtampes,</hi> he cauſeth it to be diſman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled. Many ſucceſſes hapned to the King's party through all <hi>France.</hi>

               <p>The Pope reſolves to ſend aid to the League againſt the King. He declares Cardinal <hi>Henrico Gaetano</hi> Legate to the League of <hi>France.</hi> He appointed moreover a ſelect number of Prelates to accompany the Legate, men of good Learning, and experienced in the matters of Government, among whom were <hi>Lorenzo B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

To the choice of theſe men the Pope added Bills of Exchange to the Merchants of <hi>Lions</hi> for three hundred thouſand crowns, with Commiſſion to the Legate to diſpoſe of them according to occaſion, but particularly to ſpend them for the infranchiſement of the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> upon which he ſhewed his mind was fixed more than upon any other thought whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
               <p>But the Pope by letters from the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> found, that what the Agents of the League had repreſented to him, was vain: whereupon the Pope gave Orders and Commiſſions to his Legate, to ſhew himſelf no leſs Neutral in the ſecular pretenſions of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, than moſt zealous concerning Religion, and not to value one <hi>French-man</hi> above another, provided he were obedient to the Church, and generally liked by the Kingdom: and that he ſhould not ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an open enemy to the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> ſo long as there was any hope he might return into the boſom of the Church.</p>
               <p>But theſe advertiſements were very contrary to the principal ſcope of the Embaſſy, which was to uphold the Catholick party of the League, as the foundation of that Religion in <hi>France,</hi> ſo that the ſubſtance of the buſineſs changed in the variety of circumſtances, did ſo diſturb the Execution, that it was afterwards governed more by the diverſity of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents than by any determinate reſolution.</p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:95405:158"/>
               <p>The Cardinal-Legate being come into <hi>France,</hi> required Colonel <hi>Alfonſo Corſo,</hi> not only to forbear moleſting <hi>Grenoble</hi> and <hi>Valence,</hi> (which Cities alone held for the League in <hi>Dauphiné</hi>) but alſo that as a Catholick and ſtranger, he ſhould forſake the King's party, and joyn with the union. But he anſwered, that he was indeed a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and an obedient Son to the See of <hi>Rome</hi> in ſpiritual things; but that having made his Fortune as a Souldier, in the ſervice of the King of <hi>France,</hi> he could not deſiſt from following him, but was bound to do what he could in the affairs of the Prince whom he ſerved. This anſwer troubled the Legate, and the rather, becauſe being come to <hi>Lions,</hi> he found the buſineſs of the League in great diſorder by the King's proſperous ſucceſs. The Count of <hi>Briſac,</hi> appointed at firſt to meet the Legate, and ſercure his paſſage; was forced to face about, and employ himſelf in the affairs of <hi>Normandy.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> invited him to come into his State, where ſtanding Neuter, he might freely take thoſe wayes as might appear moſt convenient to him. On the other ſide the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> ceaſed not to ſollicite him to come to <hi>Paris,</hi> ſhewing him that without the authority of his name, and thoſe helps which were hoped for from him, the League was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be diſſolved, and ſubdued by the King's Forces; and all the reſt of the Kingdom would remain oppreſſed by the <hi>Hugonot</hi>'s party.</p>
               <p>The Legate having overcome many difficulties, arrives at <hi>Paris,</hi> where he cauſed the Pope's <hi>Breve</hi> of the 15. of <hi>October</hi> to be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, wherein after an honourable commemoration of the merits of the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> toward the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp;c. He atteſted, that he had choſen Cardinal <hi>Gaetano</hi> Legate to the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> with power to uſe all means fitting, to protect the Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to recal Hereticks into the boſome of the Church; to reſtore the Peace and tranquillity of the Kingdom; and finally, to procure that under one only good, pious, and truly Catholick King, the people of <hi>France</hi> might to the glory of God live in quietneſs and tranquillity, after ſo many calamities of War. Wherefore he prayed and exhorted all the Orders and Degrees of <hi>France</hi> to perſevere in the Catholick Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to labour to extinguiſh and root up the evil of Hereſie, to cut off the occaſions of diſcord; and that particular enmities, quarrels, and Civil Wars being laid aſide, they ſhould reſolve to yield obedience to a lawful truly Catholick King, and the Divine worſhip being reſtored under his ſhadow, to live in charitable union and concord.</p>
               <p>Two different Declarations followed upon the publication of this <hi>Breve;</hi> one of the Parliament of <hi>Tours,</hi> by which all perſons were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to obey or acknowledge the Legate: the other of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Paris,</hi> by which all were exhorted to receive the Fatherly
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:95405:158"/> love of the Apoſtolick See, and to give due Reverence to the Legates admonitions. After which contrary Declarations, many Learned men fight for their Factions with their Pens, as the Souldiers with their Swords.</p>
               <p>Aid being deſired by the League from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>Sieur de la Mothe</hi> refuſeth to advance beyond the Frontiers of <hi>France</hi> from <hi>Flanders,</hi> unleſs the King of <hi>Spain</hi> be declared Protector of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> with authority to diſpoſe the chief part of the Temporal and Eccleſiaſtical Dignities, which Prerogatives they called, <hi>las Marcas de Juſtitia,</hi> marks of juſtice.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> will not hearken to an agreement with the King. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Lions,</hi> lately impriſoned at <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing newly ſet at liberty by Captain <hi>Du-Gaſt</hi> for a great ſumm of money, and come to <hi>Paris,</hi> is made High Chancellour to the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> and Preſident of the Council. The Pope's Legate grants unto <hi>Mayenne</hi> the three hundred thouſand crowns brought for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mayenne</hi> beſiegeth <hi>Meulan,</hi> a ſmall place, but ſeated upon the paſs of the River <hi>Seine,</hi> at the entring into <hi>Normandy,</hi> which therefore next to <hi>Pointoiſe,</hi> hindered the bringing of Victuals to <hi>Paris:</hi> where after 25. dayes ſiege, news came that the Old Caſtle at <hi>Roven,</hi> was ſeized by ſome Seditious perſons, which cauſed him to raiſe the ſiege, and march to <hi>Roven</hi> to appeaſe the troubles.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide the King beſiegeth <hi>Dreux,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne</hi> being joyned with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſupplies from <hi>Flanders,</hi> marching towards <hi>Dreux,</hi> reſolveth to fight.</p>
               <p>The <hi>German</hi> Infantry raiſed for the King of <hi>France,</hi> turn for the League under the Command of Colonel S. <hi>Paul.</hi> The Army of the League had in it four thouſand five hundred Horſe, and twenty thouſand Foot.</p>
               <p>The King's Army was but three thouſand Horſe, and eight thouſand Foot.</p>
               <p>The King's Army being refreſhed they marched toward the field of <hi>Yvry,</hi> appointed by the King for the place of Battel. Here the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies joyned, wherein the King obtained a great Victory. The King all Armed on Horſe-back viſits every Diviſion with great diligence, and exhorts his Souldiers with great vehemency. At laſt, ſtanding ſtill at the head of the main Battalion, joyning his hands, and lifting up his eyes to Heaven, He ſaid ſo loud, that he was heard by many, <hi>O Lord, thou knoweſt the intentions of my heart, and with the eye of thy Providence, thou pierceſt into my moſt ſecret thoughts. If it be beſt for this People that I ſhould attain the Crown, which belongs to me by right, do thou favour and Protect the juſtice of my Arms. But if thy will hath determined the contrary; if thou takeſt away my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:95405:159"/> take away my life alſo at the ſame time, that I may ſhed my blood fighting at the Head of thoſe who put themſelves in danger for my ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the end of which words there aroſe in the Front of the Battel a loud acclamation from thoſe that heard him, with an unanimous cry of <hi>vive le Roy:</hi> which being taken and redoubled from Squadron to Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron through the whole Army, gave an happy beginning to the Battel. The Cavalry of the League being defeated, ſave themſelves by flight. The <hi>Swiſſes</hi> laying down their Colours and Arms upon the ground, had quarter given them by <hi>Mareſchal de Biron.</hi> The <hi>Germans</hi> who having been raiſed by the King's money, had revolted to the Duke of <hi>Lorain,</hi> were all put to the ſword. The <hi>French</hi> Infantry that yielded, had their lives given them. The Duke <hi>de Mayenne</hi> fled towards <hi>Dreux,</hi> and having entred the Town, broke up the Bridge before his own people were all come, which was the reaſon that multitudes of them (the King's Army purſuing them) were miſerably drowned. The Reiters of the League fight till they are all deſtroyed. There died that day above ſix thouſand of the League, among which were the Duke of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> the <hi>Sieur de la Chaſtaigneray,</hi> and the Count <hi>d'Egmont,</hi> who was cut in pieces with all his <hi>Lanciers.</hi> Divers Lords, with 204. Enſigns and Cornets were taken by the King, with all their Canon and Baggage. On the King's ſide there were but 500. ſlain. This Battel was fought on <hi>March</hi> 14. 1590.</p>
               <p>The news of this defeat came the next day to <hi>Paris,</hi> whereat every one was afraid. But on <hi>March</hi> 16. Father <hi>Chriſtino de Nizza</hi> took an occaſion to diſcourſe on thoſe words <hi>[Whom I love, I rebuke and chaſten.]</hi> And in the Pulpit tells the <hi>Pariſians</hi> of the defeat, and by his Eloquence prevails ſo on them, that they reſolve to endure any thing for the Catholick Religion, without fearing the heavy tryal of a future ſiege, or Famine. The ſame did <hi>William Roſe, Boucher, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſt,</hi> and all the other Preachers; and laſt of all <hi>Franceſco Panigaro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> who, though he Preached in the <hi>Italian</hi> Tongue, was much fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by reaſon of the ſame of his Eloquence.</p>
               <p>After the yielding of other places, <hi>Melun</hi> is taken by the King's Army, a little Town, but well Fortified, ſeven Leagues diſtant from <hi>Paris,</hi> through which run two Currents of the River <hi>Seine,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is divided into three parts by the ſtream, and only joyned together by Bridges.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sieur de Villeroy</hi> being come to <hi>Melun</hi> to treat an agreement with the King, perſwades him by many reaſons to turn Catholick, and propounds a Ceſſation of Arms. He was ſent by the Duke of <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne</hi> unto the King. To which the King gave a large anſwer. And as to the point of Religion, he ſaid, he had already contented thoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks that followed him, who were many, of great wiſdom and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:95405:159"/> ſtrength, and very great extraction, to whoſe determination he thought all the reſt might accommodate themſelves. <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>All hope of Truce failing, the <hi>Pariſians</hi> prepared for a ſtrict ſiege from the King's Army. The people was already diſpoſed by the long exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of their Preachers, and ſollicitations of thoſe that Governed, to endure the ſiege: being wrought upon by the frequent Decrees of the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> and by the Declarations and Proteſtations of the Cardinal Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, that an agreement could not be treated with the Hereticks without damnation. Hereby mens minds were ſo confirmed, that ſome were put to death for ſaying, <hi>it was better to make peace with the King, than ſtarve with hunger.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> by many Letters aſſured them that he would relieve the City within a few weeks.</p>
               <p>To encreaſe this inclination in the people, a ſolemn Proceſſion was made, by Order from the Cardinal Legate, to implore Gods aſſiſtance in thoſe neceſſities: in which Proceſſion, the Prelates, Prieſts, and Monks of the ſeveral Religious Orders, walked all in their accuſtomed habits, but beſides them, they were Armed alſo openly with Corſlets, Guns, Swords, Partezans, and all kind of Arms offenſive and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, making at once, both a ſhew of devotion, and conſtancy of heart prepared to defend their lives; which heightened the courage of the common people.</p>
               <p>After this Proceſſion, they made another of all the Magiſtrates of the City: and among the Ceremonies of it, the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> their Governour, and other Commanders of the Souldiers, and Magiſtrates of the people, ſwore publickly in the great Church, to defend the City to the laſt man, and never make an agreement with an Heretick Prince, for any danger or calamity whatſoever ſhould befall them. The King drew nigh to <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſhuts up the paſſages of the River of <hi>Seine</hi> on every ſide, and the City is in great ſcarcity for want of Victuals. Cardinal <hi>Gondy,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> gives way that the Church Plate ſhould be turned into money, for the relief of the poor: and the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Legate diſtributed among the poor 30000. crowns extorted from the Pope with much ado. The Ambaſſadour <hi>Mendoza</hi> promiſed ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore crowns a day in Bread. The Dutcheſſes and the richeſt Lords ſold their houſhold ſtuff, jewels, and Ornaments, to relieve the urgent neceſſities of the common people.</p>
               <p>During this ſiege the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon</hi> dies at <hi>Fontenay,</hi> which produceth no alteration at all: only the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites the Deputies of the Provinces to <hi>Meaux,</hi> to chuſe another King.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> having met the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> at <hi>Conde,</hi> obtains of him 1500. <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Foot, towards the relief of <hi>Paris.</hi> In
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95405:160"/> that populous City the Famine was ſo ſore, that within the ſpace of three Months moe than an hundred thouſand died in it.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> cometh with an Army to relieve <hi>Paris;</hi> at his arrival at <hi>Meaux,</hi> he joyns with the Duke of <hi>Mayenne.</hi> The Abbot <hi>del Bené</hi> dies, a man of great abilitie in State affairs, at which the King is troubled. Upon <hi>Auguſt</hi> 30. the King riſeth from the ſiege of <hi>Paris.</hi> While the two Armies lie ſtill obſerving one another, the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſians</hi> furniſh themſelves with ſome Proviſions. The King ſends a Trumpet to the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> to challenge him to fight. The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> drawes his Army into Battalia, as if he would give Battel, goes away ſuddenly to <hi>Lagny,</hi> and deceives the King. The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> takes <hi>Lagny</hi> before the face of the King's Army, whereby the paſſage of the River <hi>Marne</hi> being freed, upon <hi>Septemb.</hi> 6. great ſtore of victuals enter into <hi>Paris.</hi>

And on <hi>July</hi> 25. he went to Maſs at St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> and made a publick and ſolemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to the ſaid Arbhbiſhop, aſſiſted by <hi>Charles</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Roven,</hi> and Nephew to the deceaſed; nine Biſhops with many other Prelates and Religious men; proteſting to live and die in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, ſwearing to defend it againſt all men. Having made profeſſion of his Faith, he performed all Ceremonies requiſite in ſo ſolemn an Act: and then he received abſolution and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, with wonderful joy and acclamation of the people.</p>
               <p>Preſently after this Act, the King ſent the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Piſani,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Gondy</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> to the Pope to yield obedience by them to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> to beſeech him to allow of his Converſion, and to countenance it with his own bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
               <p>Whilſt <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Queen of <hi>England,</hi> upon account of Religion, did with ſo great expences relieve the <hi>French</hi> King, a ſtrong rumour was ſpread in <hi>England,</hi> that he either would, or had already changed his Religion; hereupon was <hi>Thomas Wilkes</hi> ſent over into <hi>France</hi> to underſtand the certainty thereof.

The Prieſt revealing this Crime, incurs no Eccleſiaſtical cenſure. The wretch was found ſeized of a ſharp knife with two edges. He was pinched with hot Pincers, his right hand burnt off, holding the ſaid knife, his arms, legs, and thighs broken; and his body burnt to aſhes, and caſt into the River.</p>
               <p>Upon a general ſurceaſing of Arms the King aſſembled ſome of the chief of the Realm at <hi>Mante,</hi> eſpecially to hear the complaints of ſuch as ſtood in doubt of the King's change in Religion, and were grieved at divers contraventions of his Majeſties Edicts, whereby they ſuffered wrongs in all Provinces. For the <hi>Partiſans</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> continually exclaimed of the incompatibility of two Religions in <hi>France,</hi> and many were of opinion, That the King ought not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but he ſhould promiſe expreſly to baniſh all ſuch as made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of any other Religion than that which he did embrace; or at leaſt to aboliſh all publick Profeſſion. But the King employed all his care to unite his people in concord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vitry</hi> deſiring to be the firſt that ſhould re-enter under the King's obedience, as he had been the firſt that had ſeparated from it, brought back the City of <hi>Meaux. Aix, Lions, Bourges,</hi> and <hi>Orleans,</hi> ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the King.</p>
               <p>On the 22. of <hi>March,</hi> the Parliament, the Provoſt of Merchants, and the Sheriffs, having diſpoſed the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> received the King, maugre the vain endeavours of ſome remnant of the faction of the Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen. The Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> was gone into <hi>Picardy:</hi> and <hi>Briſſac,</hi> to whom he had committed the Government of <hi>Paris</hi> for ſome Months paſt, having taken it from the Count of <hi>Belin,</hi> broke his faith with him, believing he ought it rather to the King than to him.</p>
               <p>The King had a little before cauſed himſelf to be anointed at <hi>Chartres,</hi> with the Cruiſe of St. <hi>Martin</hi> of <hi>Tours.</hi> The City of <hi>Rhemes</hi> was yet in the hands of the League: but he would no longer defer his Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe he knew that <hi>That</hi> Ceremony was abſolutely neceſſary to confirm to him the affection and reſpect of his people. It was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, how that there being four or five thouſand <hi>Spaniards</hi> engarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned in <hi>Paris,</hi> and ten or twelve thouſand factious perſons of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal of the <hi>Sixteen,</hi> who all cruelly hated the King, he could neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs render himſelf Maſter of it without ſtriking ſtroak, or without ſhedding blood. His Troops having by intelligence ſeized on the Gates, Ramparts, and publick places, he entred triumphantly into the City by the new Gate, by which <hi>Henry</hi> III. had unhappily fled ſix years before, and went directly to <hi>Noſtredame</hi> to hear Maſs, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:95405:163"/> cauſe <hi>Te Deum</hi> to be ſung. Afterwards he returned to the <hi>Louvre,</hi> where he found his Officers and his Dinner ready, as if he had alwaies remained there.</p>
               <p>After Dinner he gave the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Garriſon a ſafe-conduct, and a good Convoy, to conduct them as far as the <hi>Tree of Guiſe</hi> in all ſecurity. The Garriſon departed about three a clock the ſame day of his entrance, with twenty or thirty of the moſt obſtinate Leaguers, who choſe rather to follow Strangers, than obey their natural Prince.</p>
               <p>The ſame day that he entred into <hi>Paris,</hi> the Cardinal <hi>de Peleve</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Sens,</hi> a paſſionate Leaguer, expired in his Palace of <hi>Sens.</hi> The Cardinal of <hi>Placentia,</hi> Legate from the Pope, had ſafe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to retire home, but he died by the way. <hi>Briſſac</hi> for recompence had the Staff of <hi>Mareſchal,</hi> and a place of honourable Counſellour to the Parliament. <hi>D' O</hi> was replaced in his Government of <hi>Paris,</hi> which he had under <hi>Henry</hi> III. but he died ſoon after.</p>
               <p>That part of the Parliament which was at <hi>Tours,</hi> was recalled; and that which was at <hi>Paris</hi> re-inabled (for it had been interdicted) and both re-united conjointly to ſerve the King.</p>
               <p>By noon of that day in which the King entred <hi>Paris,</hi> the City was every where peaceable; the Burgeſſes in a moment grew familiar with the Souldiers; the ſhops were opened, and the Artificers wrought in them. And the calm was ſo great, that nothing interrupted it but the ringing of the Bells, the Bonfires and the Dances which were made through the Streets, even till midnight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Balagny</hi> with his City of <hi>Cambray,</hi> turns to the King's ſide. In like manner <hi>Amiens, Beauvais,</hi> and <hi>Peronne,</hi> renounced the League. Yea the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> compounds with the King, and brings the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Rhemes, Vitry,</hi> and <hi>Mezieres,</hi> under his obedience, who in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of it, gave him the Government of <hi>Provence,</hi> from which he was obliged to withdraw the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> becauſe the people, the Parliament, and the Nobility, had taken Arms againſt him. The Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> alſo made his peace with the King on <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 26.</p>
               <p>Now the Court of Parliament revokes and diſannuls all other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, Orders, or Oaths, given or made ſince the 29. of <hi>December</hi> 1588. to the prejudice of the King's Authority and the Laws of the Realm. And eſpecially they diſannulled all that had been done againſt the honour of the deceaſed King, as well during his life, as after his deceaſe, commanding to inform of the deteſtable Parricide committed on his Perſon, and to proceed extraordinarily againſt ſuch as ſhould be found culpable. They revoked the Authority given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> under the Title of Lieutenant General of the Eſtate and Crown of <hi>France,</hi> forbidding all men to acknowledge
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:95405:163"/> him in that quality, or to yield him any aid or obedience, upon pain of High-Treaſon. They likewiſe enjoyned the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the like pains to acknowledge <hi>Henry</hi> IV. of that name, for King of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Navarre,</hi> and their King, and to yield him the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of faithful Servants and Subjects. And to all other Princes, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, Noblemen, GeBtlemen, Towns, Commonalities, and private men, to forſake that pretended Faction of the League, whereof the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> had made himſelf the Head, and to yield unto the King obedience and fealty, upon pain to the ſaid Princes, Noblemen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be degraded of their Nobility and Gentry; and they and their poſterity declared baſe, with confiſcation of Bodies and Goods: and the razing of their Towns, Caſtles and places, that ſhould infringe the King's Ordinances and Commandments. Moreover they decreed, That the 22. day of <hi>March</hi> ſhould be for ever celebrated, and the ſame day a general Proceſſion ſhould be made after the accuſtomed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, where the ſaid Court ſhould aſſiſt in their Scarlet Robes, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance to give God thanks for the happy reduction of this ſaid City to the King's obedience.</p>
               <p>Now one <hi>John Caſtel,</hi> Son of a Merchant-Draper of <hi>Paris,</hi> about the end of the year 1594. having thruſt himſelf with the Courtiers into the Chamber of the fair <hi>Gabriella,</hi> where the King was, would have ſtruck him with a knife into the belly; but the King then bowing to ſalute ſome one, the blow chanced on his face only, piercing his upper lip, and breaking a Tooth. It was not known for the preſent who had ſtruck it: but the Count of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> ſeeing this young man affrighted, ſtopt him by the Arm. He impudently confeſſed that he had given the blow, and maintained that he ought to do it. The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament condemned him to have his right hand burned, his fleſh torn off with red hot Pincers, and after to be torn in pieces by four Horſes, burnt to aſhes, and caſt into the wind.</p>
               <p>The Jeſuites, under whom this Miſcreant had ſtudied, were accuſed for exciting him to this Parricide. Among other things he heard the Fathers of that Society to ſay, That it was lawful to kill the King, That he was Excommuncated out of the Church, that he was not to be obeyed nor taken for their King, until ſuch time as he was allowed by the Pope.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Parliament Decreed, That the Prieſts, Scholars, and all others, terming themſelves of that Society of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> (as corrupters of Youth) ſhould depart within three daies after the publication of the ſaid Decree, out of <hi>Paris,</hi> and other places where they had Colledges, and within fifteen daies out of the Realm, upon pain after the ſame time to be puniſhed as guilty of high Treaſon. The houſe of <hi>Peter Caſtel,</hi> the Father of this Parricide, ſtanding before the Palace, was
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:95405:164"/> razed, and a Pillar erected, containing (for a perpetual monument) the cauſes of that ruine.</p>
               <p>Among the writings of <hi>John Guignard</hi> of <hi>Chartres,</hi> were found cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſcandalous libels againſt the King, for which he was executed. And one <hi>Francis Jacob,</hi> a Scholar of the Jeſuites of <hi>Bourges,</hi> had lately ſaid he would have killed the King, but that he held him for dead, and that another had done the deed.</p>

               <p>Then the <hi>French</hi> King, who had hitherto flouriſhed in Martial glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, having now his thoughts wholly ſetled upon peace, did ſo promote the welfare of <hi>France,</hi> (which had run headlong to ruine for many years through the ſtorms of Civil War) by maintaining and ſupporting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as well the <hi>Roman</hi> as the Reformed, reviving the Laws, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Learning, reſtoring Trade and Commerce, and beautifying the Kingdom with ſplendid buildings, that he far ſurpaſſed all the Kings that were before him.</p>

               <p>In the year 1599. the King's Siſter, the Lady <hi>Katherine de Bourbon,</hi> was married to the Duke of <hi>Bar,</hi> Son to the Duke of <hi>Lorain.</hi> The Reformed Religion, in which ſhe had been bred, ſhe would not change, by reaſon (as ſhe ſaid) of her deceaſed Mother Queen <hi>Joane</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi> whoſe life and actions were held worthy to be imitated, as who had preferred ſafety of Conſcience before aſſurance of honours and greatneſs, yea, than life it ſelf: Being accuſtomed to ſay to them on her part, that Arms ſhould not be laid down, but with theſe three Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>either an aſſured Peace, an abſolute Victory, or an honeſt Death.</hi> The Marriage was conſummate in the King's own Cabinet, by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Roven,</hi> at the King's ſpecial Command, to avoid greater inconvenencies.</p>
               <p>She cordially affected that which did concert the Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience throughout all <hi>France,</hi> often beſeeching the King to let her ſee the aſſurances thereof whilſt ſhe was in <hi>France,</hi> and not to ſuffer his Edicts to remain without execution being Proclaimed, and without a durable obſervation being executed.</p>
               <p>She uſed to be attended in her houſe by the Miniſters of <hi>Paris,</hi> who ſerved her by turns every one a quarter of a year.

               <p>The Harbingers of the Princeſs being come to <hi>Vitris le Francois,</hi> a Town of <hi>Champagne,</hi> addreſſed themſelves to the chief Magiſtrate of the Town, to prepare quarters for the Princeſs and her Court.

               <p>Thoſe of the Reformed Religion made many and great complaints, that the King's Edicts were not kept nor obſerved; that they were not provided of all things neceſſary for the exerciſe of their Religion, the liberty of their Conſciences, and ſafety of their perſons and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. That they were excluded from all charges and Offices in the State, juſtice, treaſure, and policie, to the great prejudice of their Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The end of all their Aſſemblies was to obtain an
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95405:165"/> Edict from the King, ſo clear and plain, as they ſhould not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to ſue for any other. Then the King made an Edict at <hi>Nantes,</hi> and ſigned it after he had reduced that Province to his obedience, containing a Declaration of the Edicts of Pacification, and of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles grown in <hi>France</hi> for matter of Religion, the which though gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>April</hi> 1598. was not allowed in the Court of Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> until the 25. day of <hi>February</hi> following, by reaſon of the many oppoſitions and difficulties that were made againſt it. The Ducheſs of <hi>Bar,</hi> would not go out of <hi>Paris</hi> before it was confirmed, ſuch was her zeal and affection in that matter, as in all other affairs of that nature.</p>
               <p>And for the better ſatisfaction of the Proteſtants in matters of juſtice, it pleaſed King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. to erect a Chamber in the Court of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament of <hi>Paris</hi> purpoſely for them.

It was at the Court before a few, but Grave and Select aſſiſtants. After ſome diſpute, when <hi>Du Perron</hi> gave back to the force of an Argument, and was at a loſs, ſome body hid behind the hangings cried up <hi>One.</hi> And when the like hapned to him the ſecond time, the ſame voice cried up <hi>Two,</hi> and ſo till <hi>Five.</hi> Upon which <hi>Du Perron</hi> complaining of interruption broke the Conference.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Beaulieu Bouju,</hi> a young Clergy-man, having got ſome Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts of <hi>Du Perron</hi> about the Euchariſt, made uſe of them to write againſt <hi>Du Moulin,</hi> who thereby was provoked to anſwer him, and confute him. There are Letters extant, and Printed among <hi>Du Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi> Works, wherein he chides that ſame <hi>Beaulieu Bouju,</hi> both for ſtealing, and more for ill uſing his meditations, and tells him in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that though he could get his weapon, yet he could not wield it.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. to ſatisfie the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of the care he took of his Siſter's Converſion, would often deſire her to hear the Sermons of his Chaplains; which ſhe would not yield unto, till once being made ſenſible how the King's credit was intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that ſhe ſhould once at the leaſt, hear one Court Sermon, ſhe condeſcended ſo far to the requeſt of a King and a Brother, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to hear Father <hi>Cotton;</hi> who therefore was appointed to preach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King and her immediately after <hi>Du Moulins</hi> Sermon, and in the ſame Room: for thoſe two contrary ſervices were performed in the ſame Room every Lord's day morning, as long as the Princeſs lived, and was at the Court.</p>
               <p>The Princeſs, to ſtrengthen her ſelf againſt that aſſault, gave notice of it to <hi>Du Moulin,</hi> and after his Sermon brought him into a private
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95405:166"/> Room, whence he might hear the Jeſuites Oratory. His Subject was the dwelling of the Holy-Ghoſt in the Soul, and he made his entry into that matter after this manner. <hi>I went once</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to viſit the Hoſpital of Fools,</hi> where a grave old man received me kindly at the door, and went about with me to ſhew me the diſtracted perſons, and inform me about their ſeveral kinds of folly. Here is <hi>one</hi> (ſaid he) that thinks himſelf made of Snow, and will not come near the fire for fear of melting. <hi>This</hi> thinks himſelf metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into an earthen Pitcher, and will not ſuffer any to come near him for fear of being broken with a knock. <hi>Theſe four</hi> think themſelves top full with the ſpirit of Prophecie: one will be <hi>Elias,</hi> another <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> another <hi>Daniel,</hi> another St. <hi>Paul.</hi> But I that am the Holy-Ghoſt (ſaid he) can aſſure you Sir, that they are all either Fools or Impoſtors, for I never ſent them. The like folly is to be ſeen among thoſe of the pretended Reformed Religion. There you ſhall find wiſe and Religious Princeſſes [intimating the King's Siſter] Wiſe and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Treaſurers [intimating the Duke of <hi>Sully</hi>] Wiſe and valiant Generals of Armies [intimating the Duke of <hi>Bovillon</hi>] Wiſe and learned Counſellours of State [intimating Mr. <hi>Du Pleſſis Mornay</hi>] All wiſe in all things, but that they think they have the Holy-Ghoſt, but have it not. The Sermon was ſuitable to the Preface, and wrought an anſwerable effect in the Hearers, making them all mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but no Converts.</p>
               <p>The worthy Dr. <hi>Peter Du Moulin,</hi> Son to the ſaid <hi>Du Moulin,</hi> tells us in his life, that in the end of the year 1601. time and place being appointed for a Conference between <hi>Du Moulin</hi> and <hi>Cayer,</hi> ſometimes a Miniſter, and then a Doctor of <hi>Sorbon, Cayer</hi> put off the meeting ſeveral times till the King's Siſter going to <hi>Lorain,</hi> took <hi>Du Moulin</hi> along with her. In his abſence <hi>Cayer</hi> put forth a Book with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, <hi>A Conference by Miniſters granted, and by them refuſed.</hi> In which Book he accuſeth <hi>Du Moulin</hi> of deſerting his Cauſe, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away. But <hi>Du Moulin</hi> being returned in <hi>May</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge was renewed on both ſides. So they met on <hi>May</hi> 28. 1602. in an houſe next to the King's Siſters houſe. The Conference held a fortnight. They had Scribes on both ſides; multitudes of hearers, and good order kept.</p>
               <p>The Queſtions agitated Propounded by <hi>Cayer</hi> himſelf, were, <hi>Of the Sacrifice of the Maſs; of the Adoration of the Prope, and of the veneration of holy Images. Cayer</hi> was aſſiſted with two Doctors, <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites; Du Moulin</hi> had no aſſiſtant. Toward the midſt of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the Faculty of <hi>Sorbon</hi> grievouſly cenſured <hi>Cayer</hi> for ill defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Catholick cauſe, and ſuffering the Adverſary to wade too deep into queſtions: and the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> forbad him to ſign that which he had indicted to the Scribes.</p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:95405:166"/>
               <p>The Doctors of <hi>Sorbon</hi> perceiving that the more the Conference continued, the more their Cauſe was diſcredited, came in a body to the King's Advocate in the Court of Parliament, to complain of that Conference, ſaying, that it was a pernicious thing, tending to Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that they had contrived how to break it, and that the effects of it would ſhortly appear. This hindered <hi>Du Moulin</hi> from coming to the ordinary place, where he was before <hi>Cayer.</hi> The Maſter of the houſe would have kept him out: but <hi>Cayer</hi> coming ſoon after, the door was opened to him; and the people preſſing in after him, <hi>Du Moulin</hi> got in with the Crowd. There they conſidered how to get ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place for their meeting. But the Conference being diſcountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Authority, no body durſt offer his houſe for it. So the parties agreed to continue the Conference in writing, and to publiſh nothing but by mutual conſent. But <hi>Du Moulin</hi> asked two Conditions, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which <hi>Cayer</hi> brake. The one that the Conference ſhould be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that it ſhould not be permitted to make replies <hi>in infinitum,</hi> but <hi>Cayer</hi> would have no limitation. The other, that <hi>Cayer</hi> ſhould ſign the Acts of that Conference till that day, which <hi>Cayer</hi> utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, ſaying, It was enough that it was ſubſcribed by the Scribes. When <hi>Du Moulin</hi> repreſented to him, what diſgrace he put upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Cauſe, and challenged him; <hi>Cayer</hi> anſwered, that he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not for the talk of the people, nor for challenges. And to get out of that mire he moved a queſtion to <hi>Du Moulin,</hi> whether he could tell after what manner of Creation the Angels were created. <hi>Du Moulin</hi> knowing that this was their laſt meeting, anſwered, that the Queſtion in hand was only of ſubſcribing the Acts. But <hi>Cayer</hi> refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing turned his back, and ſaid, you ſhall hear of me: and ſo went away, to the great ſcandal of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> there preſent. A Proteſtant made the company laugh, ſaying, that <hi>Cayer</hi> was not yet of Age to ſign.</p>
               <p>Thus was the Conference broken, to the great ſatisfaction of many faithful ſouls, and the inſtruction of many ignorant Papiſts, who ſince gave glory to God by an open Profeſſion of the truth.</p>
               <p>The Acts of the Conference are extant, publiſhed by <hi>Archibald Adaire</hi> a Reverend Biſhop of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Doctors of the Faculty of <hi>Sorbon</hi> ſtung with the ill ſucceſs of this Conference, provoked him to another, in which the body of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity took intereſt. They were to oppoſe three daies upon what points they thought beſt: and <hi>Du Moulin</hi> was to oppoſe three daies alſo, and chooſe what points he pleaſed. He was then Reſpondent for three daies, and found in the Diſpute that bleſſing of God which never was wanting to him in the defence of his truth. After the Diſpute of the third day, he being returned home, and retired to his ſtudy, a man in a Prieſt's habit came in the dark evening up the ſtairs, and knockt at his Study
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:95405:167"/> door. When <hi>Du Moulin</hi> had opened it, the man thruſt the door with all his ſtrength to have ruſht in: and <hi>Du Moulin</hi> with all his ſtrength (in which he was inferiour to few men of his ſize) kept him out, and called for help. The man hearing ſome ſtirring below, ran haſtily down the ſtairs, and ſo into the Street. It is ſuppoſed upon probable ground, that the man was come to kill him before he preſented himſelf to be opponent according to the Covenants of the Conference. But on the next morrow he met with a Prohibition from the King to continue that Conference any longer. Theſe paſſages raiſed his reputation very high, whereby God was glorified, his Truth confirmed, and his Church edified and increaſed with many Converts.</p>
               <p>The laſt ſickneſs of the King's Siſter gave a great exerciſe to his zeal and induſtry, whereby he did faithfully and conſtantly aſſiſt her in that extremity. <hi>Du Perron</hi> did his utmoſt to pervert her and to fright him away. When ſhe drew near to her end, <hi>Du Moulin</hi> ſtanding by her Bed ſide, <hi>Du Perron</hi> came, and ſaid, he was ſent by the King, and would remove him by plain force. But <hi>Du Moulin</hi> held faſt the Bed-poſt. And when <hi>Du Perron</hi> told him he was to take place of him in all Companies, <hi>Du Moulin</hi> anſwered, that his place was before <hi>Du Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>'s at the Princeſſes Beds ſide, and in that ſervice. He added, that he believed not that the King would offer violence to his Siſters Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, appealing to her ſelf, and beſeeching her Highneſs to declare her pleaſure. She declared that ſhe would die in the Reformed Religion, and that ſhe would have <hi>Du Moulin</hi> to ſtay by her. Whereupon <hi>Du Perron</hi> withdrew, and the good Princeſs perſevered in God's truth to her laſt breath. The King wiſht ſhe had died in the <hi>Roman</hi> Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and did all he could without violence, to pleaſure the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> in that point.</p>
               <p>A little before there was a Conference between the Biſhop of <hi>Eureux</hi> and <hi>Philip de Mornay</hi> Lord of <hi>Pleſſis Marly,</hi> Governour of <hi>Saumur,</hi> in the preſence of the King, Princes, and Officers of his Crown, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours of State, and other Noblemen of Mark. It was touching a Book which <hi>Monſieur du Pleſſis</hi> had publiſhed of the Inſtitution of the Lords Supper, and againſt the Maſs, wherein the Biſhop did tax him to have falſified many Authorities. Whereupon <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented a Petition unto the King, that his Majeſty would be pleaſed to appoint Commiſſioners to examine every paſſage of Scripture cited in his Book. The King yielded to this Conference, referring the care thereof to his Chancellour. The Commiſſioners appointed for the Catholicks were <hi>Auguſtus Thuanus,</hi> Preſident of the Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Paris: Pithou,</hi> Advocate in the Court, and <hi>Fleure,</hi> School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> in whoſe abſence came <hi>Martin</hi> the King's Phyſitian. And for the other, the Preſident of <hi>Calignon,</hi> Chancellour of <hi>Navarre,</hi> in whoſe place entred <hi>De Freſnes Gavay,</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:95405:167"/> Preſident of the Chamber of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac Caſaubon,</hi> his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Reader for the Greek Tongue. All men of great Learning and well skilled in the Tongues.</p>
               <p>This Conference began on <hi>May</hi> 4. in the Hall at <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Serres Hiſt in <hi>Henry</hi> IV.</note> in the midſt whereof was a Table of a reaſonable length. At the one end ſat the King; on his right hand the Biſhop of <hi>Eureux,</hi> and on the left right againſt him <hi>Du Pleſſis. Paſquier, Vaſſaut,</hi> and <hi>Mercier,</hi> Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Conference, were at the lower end of the ſame Table. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what higher on the right hand ſate the Chancellour and the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Behind the King ſtood the Archbiſhop of <hi>Lions,</hi> and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Nevers, Beauvais,</hi> and <hi>Chaſtres.</hi> On the King's left hand were the four Secretaries of State. Behind them which conferred, were the Dukes of <hi>Vaudemont,</hi> of <hi>Nemours,</hi> of <hi>Mercoeur,</hi> of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> of <hi>Nevers,</hi> of <hi>Elbeuf,</hi> of <hi>Aiguillon,</hi> and of <hi>Janville,</hi> the Officers of the Crown, Counſellours of State, and other Noblemen of quality.</p>
               <p>All were commanded to keep ſilence. The King ſaid, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute was not betwixt party and party, but particular betwixt the two Conferents; not for any queſtion of <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> but for the literal truth of ſome paſſages. He deſired they would treat with all mildneſs and moderation; without any bitterneſs or paſſion, but that of the truth: Declaring moreover, that he did not mean that this Diſpute ſhould in any thing alter or diſquiet the peace of his Subjects, as the Chancellour did then Declare unto them at large by the King's Commandment.</p>
               <p>After the firſt daies Conference <hi>M. Du Pleſſis</hi> fell very ſick, ſo as they could proceed no further. The King did write the ſame day unto the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> what had paſt in the Conference, and ſhewed by his Letter what his judgement was. My friend, the Dioceſs of <hi>Eureux</hi> hath vanquiſhed that of <hi>Saumur.</hi> Wherewith <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> was diſcontented, ſo that in a Diſcourſe Printed ſoon after touching this Conference, he termed this Letter <hi>A ſpark of fire,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>That the Biſhop of Eureux Fly was made an Elephant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some Months after, <hi>Canay,</hi> one of the Commiſſioners, and Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the Chamber of the Edict at <hi>Caſtres,</hi> a man learned in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy and the Tongues, and well read in the Church Hiſtory, left his Profeſſion of the Reformed Religion, and became a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Catholick.</p>

                  <hi>Philip Mornay,</hi> Lord of <hi>Pleſſis,</hi> his work concerning the truth of Chriſtian Religion, was written in <hi>French</hi> againſt <hi>Atheiſts, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures, Paynims, Jews, Mahumetiſts,</hi> and other Infidels, began to be tranſlated by Sir <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> and at his requeſt finiſhed by <hi>Arthur Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> He publiſhed a Treatiſe containing the reaſons why the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> could not be admitted in <hi>France.</hi> He was ſent by the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> to the National Synod of <hi>Vitray</hi> in <hi>Bretagne,</hi> where he was
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:95405:168"/> joyfully received by the whole Company. He was likewiſe preſent in the General Aſſembly of the Proteſtants held at <hi>Montauban</hi> by the King's permiſſion, <hi>Anno</hi> 1584. Where he was deſired by the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly to draw up the form of their Complaints againſt the violation of the Edict for Peace; which He together with the Count <hi>de la Val</hi> preſented afterwards to the King at <hi>Blois.</hi>

               <p>When the League of the Houſe of <hi>Guiſe</hi> brake forth, which was formed firſt againſt the King, under pretence of the Defence of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion; and afterwards declared againſt the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> and the Proteſtants: That famous Declaration in the name of the ſaid King was Penned by <hi>Du Pleſſis.</hi> In the following Civil Wars for Religion, he did many important ſervices for the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> and the Proteſtants, both with his Sword and Pen, having anſwered a virulent Book, publiſhed by the League againſt the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> called the <hi>Engliſh Catholick.</hi> In the year 1590. he built a Church for the Proteſtants in <hi>Saumur,</hi> and obtained a Grant from the King for the inſtituting an Univerſity there, which was afterwards confirmed by a National Synod held in the ſame place. <hi>Anno</hi> 1593. he wrote a large Letter to the King, who then had changed his Religion; deſiring the continuance of his favour to the Proteſtants, and withal expoſtulating that ſudden change. <hi>Anno</hi> 1598. he Printed his Work of the Lords Supper. The Jeſuites of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> Petitioned the Parliament there that it might be burnt.</p>

The King promiſed that the Church of <hi>Sedan</hi> ſhould ſuffer no alteration, but enjoy the liberty of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p>In the year 1603. the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had an enterprize upon <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va:</hi> his men on ſcaling Ladders mounted the Walls undeſcried, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized the Souldier that ſtood Centinel, got the word of him, and ſlew him, being alſo Maſters of the Streets about two hours.

               <p>But Father <hi>Cotton</hi> returning one night ſomewhat late (about the end of <hi>February</hi>) and paſſing by the Street of the new Bridge, to go unto the <hi>Louvre,</hi> there were certain Pages and Lacquies, which cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for him at the door of the Coach, wounded him with their Rapiers, giving him one great wound in the ſhoulder going toward the neck and throat, whereof he was ſoon after cured. There was great ſearch made for this attempt. Some were taken and examined. <hi>Cotton</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted the King to pardon them, yet were they baniſhed the Court, and forbidden ever to come there upon pain of death.</p>
               <p>In the year 1606. the King made ſpecial orders on the behalf of thoſe of the Reformed Religion, enjoyning them to carry themſelves according to the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> avoiding all occaſions of ſcandal.</p>
               <p>About <hi>Eaſter</hi> this year were ſuch violent winds and ſtorms through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>France,</hi> as the tops of houſes being caſt down, many were ſlain and ſore hurt in <hi>Paris.</hi> Not long after there was a violent Plague in the ſame, and in the beginning of the following year.</p>
               <p>In the year 1608. were the Jeſuites admitted into <hi>Navarre</hi> and <hi>Bearn,</hi> whereat all the Judges and Officers of the Country were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, as who hated the Jeſuites above all Creatures living; and had in former times put them to death like Spies, if they found any with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their limits.</p>
               <p>The Prelates of <hi>France</hi> in like manner Petitioned the King once again, that the Decrees of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>

               <p>On <hi>May</hi> 13. the Queen was ſolemnly Crowned at St. <hi>Dennis</hi> by the Cardinal of <hi>Joyeuſe.</hi> On <hi>Friday May</hi> 14. the day after the Queens Coronation, the King was treacherouſly murthered by the curſed hand of a bloody villain.</p>
               <p>The King being advertiſed of ſome ominous influence and Prediction which did threaten him that day, went to ſee Maſs with great devotion. At his return they brought him ſome of his Children, among the reſt the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> whom he dearly loved: but being then very penſive, he commanded they ſhould carry him to breakfaſt. Then being very ſad he caſt himſelf upon his bed to ſleep if he might: but not being able to take any reſt, he fell upon his knees, and began to pray. Then he lay down again, and prayed again, and thus he did three times. In the end he went and walked in the Gallery till dinner time. After dinner many Noblemen came into his Chamber, and began to tell ſome tales to make him laugh. Having ſmiled a little with the reſt (being naturally of a pleaſant diſpoſition) in the end he ſaid, <hi>We have laughed enough for Friday, we may well weep on Sunday.</hi> Hereupon he cauſed ſome to go to the <hi>Arſenal</hi> at four of the clock. Whereupon, they ſay, that the Duke of <hi>Vendoſme</hi> told him, that he had been warned to beware of the 14. day: yet making no account thereof, he went down into the Court, where a man of a mean condition entertained him a quarter of an hour. Then he went into his Coach by the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> (who ſate in the firſt place of the Boot on the King's right hand) <hi>Montbazon</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal of <hi>Lavardin, la Force</hi> and <hi>Praulin,</hi> being followed by two Foot-men, and one of his Guard on Horſe-back, having commanded <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Vitry,</hi> and the reſt of his Guard to ſtay behind.</p>
               <p>Being between the Draw-bridge and the Port, a miſerable wretch, <hi>Francis Ravillac,</hi> born at <hi>Angouleſm,</hi> by Profeſſion a Lawyer, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his opportunity, drew near unto the Coach on the right ſide, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:95405:170"/> his Majeſty had been ther; but ſeeing he was on the left hand, and hearing them command the Coach-man to drive on, he went the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt way by narrow Lanes, and met with the Coach again in the Street called <hi>Ferroniere,</hi> near <hi>Innocents</hi> Church, where ſtaying to make way for a Cart to paſs, the King leaned down on the one ſide towards the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> preſſing him to read a Letter without Spectacles. <hi>Montbazon</hi> with the Mareſchal <hi>de la Vardin</hi> was in one of the Boots, who turned toward them; and one of the Footmen was buſie in tying up his garter on the other ſide; ſo that this Monſter had the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſtab the King in the left Pap; but the wound was not great. Whereupon crying out, <hi>O my God I am wounded,</hi> he gave him a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond blow which was mortal; the knife entring between the Fifth and Sixth Rib, it cut aſunder the Vein leading to the heart. And the wound was ſo deep, that it entred into <hi>Cava Vena,</hi> the which was pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; wherewith the King did preſently ſpit blood, loſing all appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion and knowledge for any thing they could perceive: who being carried back into the <hi>Louvre,</hi> was laid upon a Couch in his Cabin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

After whoſe death the Queen-Mother was declared Regent in <hi>France;</hi> by whoſe Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the King's heart was delivered to the Jeſuites, to be laid up in their Colledge of <hi>la Fleche,</hi> as the King himſelf had long before reſolved. The firſt Edict at <hi>Nantes</hi> was alſo confirmed, for the entertainment whereof a Declaration was made by <hi>Lewes</hi> the young King.</p>
               <p>The Murtherer being arraigned was put to the Rack on <hi>May</hi> 25. and on the 27. had the Sentence of death given againſt him. His execution was after this manner. He was brought out of the Priſon in his ſhirt, with a Torch of two pound weight lighted in one hand; and the knife wherewith he had murthered the King, chained in the other. Then was he ſet upright in a Tumbrel or dung Cart; and ſo he was conducted with a good Guard to our Ladies Church, where he did pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. After this he was accompanied to the place of Execution by two Doctors of Divinity, who ſtill perſwaded him to ſave his ſoul from everlaſting puniſhment by revealing his Aſſociates; the which he would not. In this manner he was carried to the <hi>Greve,</hi> where there was a ſtrong Scaffold built for his Execution. At his coming up on the Scaffold he croſſed himſelf, in token that he died a Papiſt. Then was he bound to an Engine of wood: which done, his hand with the knife chained to it (wherewith he had ſlain the King) was put into a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace then flaming with Fire and Brimſtone, wherein it was in a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner conſumed; and yet he would not confeſs any thing, but caſt forth horrible cries like a ſoul tormented in Hell. Then the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioners having made Pincers red hot in the ſame Furnace, they did pinch his Paps, the brawns of his arms and thighs, with the calves of his legs, and other fleſhy parts of his body, pulling out collops of fleſh,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:95405:171"/> and burning them before his face. Then they poured into thoſe wounds ſcalding Oyl; Rozen, Pitch, and Brimſtone melted together. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they ſet a hard roundel of Clay upon his Navil, having an hole in the midſt, into the which they poured molten Lead; yet he revealed nothing, but roared out moſt horribly. Then they cauſed four ſtrong Horſes to be brought to tear his Body in pieces. But theſe Horſes could not of a long time pull him aſund<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r (though another very ſtrong Horſe was put in the place of one of the four, who ſtrained but faintly) until they were conſtrained to cut the veins under his arms and thighs, by which means his body was the eaſier torn in pieces. Then the enraged multitude pulled this diſmembred Carkaſs out of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioners hand, which they dragged up and down through the dirt: and cutting off the fleſh with their knives; the bones which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed were burnt at the place of execution, and the aſhes ſcattered in the wind. His Father and Mother were commanded to depart the Land, and never to return again. His Brethren, Siſters, Uncles, and others his Kinsfolk, enjoined to take another Name. His goods were declared forfeited to the King, and the houſe where he had been born to be beaten down.</p>
               <p>This wicked Parricide confeſſed no other motive of his Crime, but the Book of <hi>Mariana,</hi> a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Jeſuite. Which Book by a Decree made by the Colledge of <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> and confirmed by a ſentence from the Courts of Parliament, was for that cauſe by a ſentence condemned to be publickly burnt before our Ladies Church in <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the execution of <hi>Ravillac,</hi> there was a foul imputation laid on the Jeſuites; and many condemned them as Abettors and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the Murtherers of Princes: for which cauſe Father <hi>Cotton</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys all his Wit and Eloquence to wipe it off, in whoſe behalf the Biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> wrote, which (as a Preface) was prefixt before his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, and Printed.</p>
               <p>But the Learned <hi>Du Moulin</hi> put forth that famous Book, called <hi>Anticoton,</hi> in which he proved that the Jeſuites were Authours of that horrible Parricide. Though he put not his name to it, yet the Jeſuites ſoon knew that it was his Work, and made an anſwer to it directed unto him, becauſe there was in the <hi>Anticoton</hi> an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram, of Father <hi>Cotton,</hi> which fathered the King's death upon him thus.

               <p>On <hi>May</hi> 27. 1611. began the Aſſembly of the Reformed Churches at <hi>Saumur,</hi> whereat many Dukes and Noblemen of the Reformed Religion were preſent, where <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> was choſen Preſident.

               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:95405:173"/>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> to manifeſt his gratitude to King <hi>Henry</hi> III. his Maſter and Benefactor, begged of the Queen Regent to give him leave to perform his Funeral Rites, he having formerly after the death of the ſaid King, attended his Body to <hi>Compeigne,</hi> where the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of War, and the confuſions of the times permitted not at that time the performance thereof.</p>
               <p>The Queen readily conſented to his requeſt, ſo that the Duke with a great company of Lords and Gentlemen, went to fetch the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy from <hi>Compeigne,</hi> from whence he conveyed it to St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> where it was depoſited in the ancient Sepulchre of the Kings of <hi>France.</hi> A little before his death the Duke cauſed a Marble Pillar, one of the moſt excellent pieces of Architecture of theſe late times, to be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſet up in the Church of S. <hi>Clou,</hi> wherein he was ſo curious, as to make it to be wrought in his own houſe, and almoſt in his own ſight; his deſign being to found a Revenue of a thouſand Liuvres year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the ſervice of the Chappel where it was erected; which was alſo adorned with Pictures, and paved with Marble at his own charge.</p>
               <p>But ſome difficulties ariſing about the ſettlement of that foundation, which could not be cleared before his death, the thing (to his great grief) remained unperfect.</p>
               <p>In the end of the year 1611. the ſuit between the Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Jeſuites was decided, <hi>Monſieur Servin</hi> concluding for the Univerſity againſt the Jeſuites: to whom theſe four Articles were propounded to be by them ſubſcribed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the General Council was above the Pope.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Pope hath no Temporal Power over Kings, and could not by Excommunication deprive them of their Realms and Eſtates.</p>

                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1612. by a Decree of the Court of Parliament a certain Book written in Latine by <hi>Gaſpar Scoppius,</hi> entituted <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> tending to the Rebellion of Subjects againſt Sovereign Power, and containing an infinite number of execrable blaſphemies, and ſcandalous aſſertions againſt the glorious memory of the deceaſed King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. was burnt by the Hang-man publickly in the Palace-yard.</p>

               <p>Whilſt M. <hi>Du Moulin</hi> lived in <hi>Paris,</hi> he was invited by many Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities to accept of the Chair of Divinity; but the Church of <hi>Paris</hi> would never part with him.</p>
               <p>The Univerſity of <hi>Leyden</hi> did moſt conſtantly court him, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſtill as a member of their Body. They began in the year 1611. and offered him the place of <hi>Arminius</hi> then newly dead. And not only the Curators by frequent addreſſes to the Church of <hi>Paris</hi> and to him, but the States by their Ambaſſadours, and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> by his Letters did from time to time demand him.</p>
               <p>Before the death of King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> deſired leave of that King to retire himſelf, which the King unwillingly granted, withal deſiring him to come ſometimes to Court. Being returned to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment at <hi>Saumur,</hi> he began his work of the Myſtery of Iniquity, <hi>Anno.</hi> 1607. which he finiſhed in nine Months.</p>
               <p>Then he began to ſet on thoſe great Volumes of <hi>Baronius,</hi> to which he intended a Confutation. <hi>Du Perron</hi> was much preſſed by the King to anſwer <hi>Du Pleſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Upon his return the King demanded of him when he would Print it? he told his Majeſty that he ſtayed but for ſome Manuſcripts from <hi>Rome.</hi> Which anſwer the King (ſeeing his delays) uſed as a Proverb to ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, whoſe work went not forward, making idle excuſes to him: Yes, ſaith the King, I ſee you ſtay for Manuſcripts from <hi>Rome</hi> too.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſaubon,</hi> who was about the Cardinal, wrote to <hi>Monſieur Du Pleſſis</hi> concerning this anſwer, telling him that it was finiſhed, and that himſelf had ſeen it. <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> deſired <hi>Caſaubon</hi> to give him from him the ſame Counſel which Chriſt did to <hi>Judas</hi> in the Goſpel, <hi>What thou doſt, do quickly.</hi> But this Volume of anſwer never appeared; the Cardinal after the King's murther accounting himſelf to be diſengaged from his promiſe. <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> turned his <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity</hi> into Latine, which he dictated ſo faſt, that his <hi>Amanuenſis</hi> had much ado with his pen to keep pace with him.</p>
               <p>After the horrid Murther of the King, he took ſo good order as to keep the people about his Government in quiet: and as ſoon as he had received an Edict for the Regency of the Queen-Mother, he admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred the Oath of fidelity to all the Clergy and People within his juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:95405:174"/> making a ſpeech unto them, in which he deſired them to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the diſtinguiſhing names of <hi>Papiſt</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards a diſſention aroſe between <hi>Monſieur Du Moulin</hi> Miniſter of the Church at <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>Tilenus,</hi> Profeſſour at <hi>Sedan,</hi> about the effects of the union of the natures in Chriſt. The making up of this difference was by a National Synod held at <hi>Tonneinx,</hi> referred to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Du Pleſſis,</hi> who proved the happy Authour of a full reconciliation between them in the year 1614. Yet had this difference like to have broke forth again the year following, by indiſcretion (or malice rather) of ſome particular perſons, had not <hi>Monſieur Du Pleſſis</hi> in time ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped its progreſs.</p>
               <p>In the year 1615. King <hi>James</hi> ſent by Sir <hi>Theodore Mayerne</hi> to invite <hi>Du Moulin</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> to confer with him about a Method of uniting all the Reformed Churches of Chriſtendom, to which he had been often ſolicited by <hi>Monſieur Du Pleſſis.</hi> The iſſue of which voyage was, That King <hi>James</hi> reſolved to ſend Letters to all Proteſtant Princes, to invite them to Union; and deſired the <hi>French</hi> Churches to frame a Confeſſion, gathered out of all thoſe of other Reformed Churches, in the which unneceſſary Points might be left out, as the means of begetting diſcord and diſſention.</p>
               <p>Two Months before <hi>Du Moulin</hi>'s coming into <hi>England, Du Perron</hi> had made an Oration in the States aſſembled at <hi>Blois;</hi> where he had maintained, that the Pope had power to depoſe Kings, and had uſed King <hi>James</hi> very ill; and having publiſhed it in Print, he ſent it to his Majeſty. To anſwer that Oration King <hi>James</hi> made uſe of <hi>Du Moulin</hi>'s ſervice for the <hi>French</hi> Language; and it was Printed the firſt time in <hi>French</hi> while <hi>Du Moulin</hi> was in <hi>England</hi> in that year 1615. before it was Printed in <hi>Engliſh.</hi> The King going to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> carried <hi>Du Moulin</hi> along with him, and made him take the Degree of Doctor.</p>
               <p>The Doctor at his return into <hi>France</hi> Landed at <hi>Bullen,</hi> where <hi>Monſieur de Compagnoles</hi> was Governour for the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon.</hi> It was the time when the <hi>French</hi> Princes began to ſtir againſt <hi>Mary</hi> the Queen-Mother of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And becauſe the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was courting the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to joyn with him in that deſign, the Doctor was ſuſpected, as having taken that journey to procure help from <hi>England</hi> for the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Wherefore <hi>Campagnoles</hi> was charged to arreſt him at his Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which he did, and committed him to the Guard of two Souldiers, ſeized upon his Trunks and Papers, and ſearched them. But after two daies, he releaſed him, deſiring him to tell no man of the wrong he had done him.</p>
               <p>The Doctor finding at his return, that the Proteſtants began to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage with the Princes againſt the Queen-mother, and in effect againſt
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:95405:174"/> the King, who was then declared <hi>Major</hi> by the Parliament, he diſſwaded them from it (as much as he could) both by Letters and Sermons. And unto him the Court was obliged, that all the Proteſtant Tows on this ſide the <hi>Loire</hi> kept in the King's obedience. He ſhewed, that he did it not to ſerve the times, but to ſerve God. The declaring of the Politick Aſſembly of the Proteſtants for the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> in the year 1616. was the greateſt error that ever they committed; and they ſmarted for it, as ſoon as the young King had got more Age and vigour.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> laboured much in procuring the peace of the Proteſtant Churches, endeavouring to keep a good correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence between the King and them, which was continually ready to be interrupted: in which buſineſs he carried himſelf with ſo much prudence and fidelity in all occurences between them, that he was admired and praiſed by all. Yea, even Cardinal <hi>Du Perron</hi> himſelf (heretofore one of his greateſt enemies) ſhewed him great reſpect in the Aſſembly of States held at <hi>Roven, Anno</hi> 1617. Speaking of him in all companies with an exceſs of Praiſes; and telling the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that thoſe men had done him wrong, who had kept off <hi>Monſieur Du Pleſſis</hi> from having a greater Power in the management of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs: And that his Religion ought not to render him unprofitable in the exerciſe of thoſe graces which God had given him; and that his Majeſty ought to keep him near his perſon ſo long as he ſhould live.</p>
               <p>After the return of Dr. <hi>Du Moulin</hi> out of <hi>England,</hi> the Jeſuite <hi>Arnoux</hi> a Court Preacher, ſent a challenge to the Miniſters of <hi>Paris</hi> to appear before the Queen-Mother to give account of their Religion, preacht fire and ſword againſt them before their Majeſties; and ſent them a Pamplet full of heavy accuſations. The Doctor was charged by his Colleagues to make an anſwer to it: which he did, and addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it to the King.</p>
               <p>In that anſwer by way of juſt recrimination he affirmed, that he had ſeen in the Colledge of the Jeſuites at <hi>la Fleſhe,</hi> a Picture of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs of their Order; and in that rank ſome Traytors who had been executed for conſpiring againſt the Life of their Kings. That the maxims of the Jeſuites were pernicious to Kings, whereas the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Proteſtants maintained their Life, their Authority nad their States.</p>
               <p>And the Paſtours of the Reformed Churches taught their people fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and obedience to the King. Then he repreſented the many Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils and Combates which the Proteſtants had ſuſtained for the defence of King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. till they had brought him to the Crown. Of which ſervices they that had been the King's enemies received the reward. This anſwer of the Miniſters was preſented to the King by
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:95405:175"/> the Duke of <hi>Rohan.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See the Life of Dr. <hi>Du Moulin.</hi>
                  </note> This bold addreſs to the King irritated the great Officers of the Crown, of whom not a few, or their Fathers, had been of the party of the League. The Jeſuites therefore letting their challenge fall, indicted the Miniſters of Treaſon, although all the ground they could find for it was, that the Miniſters called the Reformed Churches <hi>their people,</hi> as if they had pretended ſome Soveraignty over them. The Miniſters being ſummoned before the Council, the indictment of Treaſon was not much urged, as being but a Cavil. After grave Admonitions and high threatnings by Chancellour <hi>Bruſlart,</hi> they diſmiſſed them.</p>
               <p>That challenge of <hi>Arnoux,</hi> and a Pamphlet of his againſt the confeſſion of Faith of the Reformed Churches in <hi>France,</hi> occaſioned the Doctor to write his <hi>Buckler of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Jeſuite came to the Doctors Study to diſpute with him. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Monginot,</hi> a famous Phyſitian, was preſent at the Conference, whereby he was converted, and ſet out an excellent Book of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why he abjured Popery. He had many encounters; and to relate all his Conferences migh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He was the object of the publick hatred of the <hi>Romaniſts.</hi> His name was the general Theme of Libels cryed up in the Streets, of railing Sermons in all Pulpits, and of the curſes of ignorant Zealots.</p>
               <p>The Popiſh Clergy in the year 1617. being aſſembled at the houſe of <hi>Auſtin-Friers</hi> in <hi>Paris</hi> (as every two years they uſed to do) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to take their leaves of the King, elected the Biſhop of <hi>Aire</hi> to be their Spokeſ-man, and to certifie his Majeſty of their grievances. In performing which buſineſs, the principal thing of which he ſpake was to this purpoſe, That whereas his Majeſty was bound to give them Fathers, he gave them Children. That the name of <hi>Abbot</hi> ſignifies a Father, and the Function of a Biſhop was full of Fatherly authority: yet <hi>France</hi> notwithſtanding was now filled with Biſhops and Abbots, which are yet in their Nurſes arms, or elſe under their Regents in Colledges. Nay more, that the abuſe goeth before the Being, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren being commonly deſign'd to Biſhopricks and Abbacies before they were born.</p>
               <p>He alſo made another complaint, that the Soveraign Courts by their Decrees had attempted upon the Authority which was Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Clergy, even in that which concerned meerly Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Diſcipline and Government of the Church. To theſe complaints he gave them indeed a very gracious hearing, but it never went fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a hearing, being never followed by redreſs. The Court of Parliament knew too well the ſtrength of their own Authority: and the King was loth to take from himſelf thoſe excellent advantages of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:95405:175"/> binding to himſelf his Nobility, by the ſpeedy preferring of their Children. So the Clergy departed with a great deal of envy, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>In the ſame year the States of the United Provinces deſired the Churches of <hi>England, Germany, France,</hi> &amp;c. to ſend ſome able Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines to the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> whereupon the Churches of <hi>France</hi> named four, <hi>viz.</hi> Dr. <hi>Du Moulin, Chamier, Rivet,</hi> and <hi>Chaune.</hi> But when the Doctor was making ready for his journey, he was forbidden by a meſſenger of the Council of State of <hi>France</hi> to go out of the Kingdom upon pain of death. The like prohibition was made to the three other Divines.</p>

He was killed at <hi>Montaubon</hi> with a Canon Bullet (which had a C. on it) on the Lords day.

               <p>In the year 1618. the Lords States and the Curators of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Leyden</hi> renewed a former demand of theirs concerning Dr. <hi>Du Moulin</hi> to be their Divinity Reader.

               <p>The Queens affairs having ill ſucceſs, all thoſe who had engaged in her party, were abandoned to the King's mercy: but as for her ſelf ſhe was permitted to come to Court.

               <p>In the year 1620. a National Synod of the Proteſtants being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at <hi>Alais</hi> in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> Dr. <hi>Du Moulin</hi> was ſent Deputy to it; and he made account in his return to go out of the way to ſee <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel.</hi> A little before he took that journey, the Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> of <hi>Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> then Ambaſſadour of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> urged him to write to the King his Maſter, to exhort him to undertake vigorouſly, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his Son in Law the King of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> So the Doctor writ to the King, and deliv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the mean while his Letters to King <hi>James</hi> were delivered to the Council of State in <hi>France,</hi> how or by whom the Doctor could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver learn. Scarce was he in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> when it was concluded at <hi>Paris</hi> in the ouncil of State, that he ſhould be apprehended, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Priſoner, for exhorting a foreign King to take Arms for the defence of the Proteſtant Churches. And becauſe the Council was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that the Doctor would return by <hi>Rochel</hi> (a place which then gave great jealouſies to the Court) they wouid not take him before he had been there; the informers againſt him intending to make his going to <hi>Rochel</hi> an Article of his indictment.</p>
               <p>The affairs of <hi>Bearn</hi> were now of ſuch a nature as that the King's preſence ſeemed to be very neceſſary there; therefore he determines to move that way, and goes to <hi>Xantonge,</hi> and from thence paſſeth over into <hi>Guienne.</hi> He is magnificently entertained by the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> two daies at <hi>Cadillac,</hi> and departs from thence to go into <hi>Bearn.</hi> He was made believe, that the Council of this little Country would ſubmit to his Royal pleaſure, without obliging him to perform that voyage; but the King muſt undergo that trouble. He went thither, where his preſence produced the ſame effect it had done in other places. He over-ran all this little Province, ſeizing (as he paſſed) on <hi>Navarrens</hi> the ſtrongeſt place in it, as he did alſo of <hi>Ortez,</hi> and <hi>Olleron,</hi> Principal Cities of that Country. He ſubverted all their antient Cuſtomes, reſtor'd the Biſhop and other Eccleſiaſticks to their Eſtates and Dignities; took away the Adminiſtration of affairs of the Country from thoſe of the Reformed Religion, and re-eſtabliſhed his own Authority: but he left the Government of the Province in the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:95405:176"/> hands of the Marqueſs <hi>de la Force</hi> ſince Mareſchal of <hi>France;</hi> who impatient to ſee his Authority cut ſo ſhort by theſe alterations, could hardly forbear till the King was got back to <hi>Paris,</hi> from reducing things again to the ſame poſture they were in before. He therefore laboured all the Winter to drive out the Garriſons of <hi>Ortez</hi> and <hi>Olle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron;</hi> ſo that excepting <hi>Navarrens,</hi> which was kept by the Marqueſs of <hi>Poianne,</hi> whom the King had left Governour there, he overthrew whatever his Majeſty had done, ſhuffling all things again into their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer confuſion.</p>
               <p>During the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. who would not ſee it, and the troubleſom minority of <hi>Lewes</hi> XIII. who could not moleſt them, the Proteſtants had made themſelves Maſters of Ninety nine Towns, well fortified and enabled for a ſiege. In the opinion of their Potency they call Aſſemblies (Parliaments as it were) when and as often as they pleaſed. There they conſulted of the Common affairs of Religion, made new Laws of Government, removed and exchanged their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Officers, the King's leave all this while never ſo much as formally asked. In this licentious calling of Aſſemblies, they abuſed their Power into a neglect; and in not diſſolving them at his Majeſties command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they encreaſed their neglect into a diſobedience.</p>
               <p>The Aſſembly which principally cauſed the War and their ruine, was that of <hi>Rochel,</hi> called by the Proteſtants preſently upon the King's journey into <hi>Bearn.</hi> This general meeting the King prohibited by his ſpecial Edicts, declaring all them to be guilty of Treaſon; which notwithſtanding they would not hearken unto, but reſolutely went on in their purpoſes.</p>
               <p>Being Aſſembled, they ſent the King a Remonſtrance of their grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, to which the Duke <hi>L' Eſdeguiers,</hi> in a Letter to them writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, gives them a very fair and plauſible anſwer, wherein alſo he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats them to obey the King's Edict, and break off the Aſſembly. Upon the receipt of this Letter thoſe of the Aſſembly publiſhed a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, wherein they verified the meeting to be Lawful, and their purpoſe not to diſmiſs themſelves till their deſires were granted.</p>
               <p>This affront done to the King, made him gather together his Forces; yet at the Duke of <hi>Leſdiguier</hi>'s requeſt, he allowed them twenty four daies reſpite before his Army ſhould march towards them. He offered them alſo very fair and reaſonable Conditions, ſuch almoſt as their Deputies had ſolicited; but far better than thoſe which they were glad to accept, when all the Towns were taken from them. In their Aſſembly they made Laws and Orders, that no peace ſhould be made without the conſent of the general Convocation, about paying of the Souldiers wages, for the detaining of the Revenues of the King and the Clergy, and the like.</p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:95405:177"/>
               <p>The Synod at <hi>Alais</hi> being ended, Doctor <hi>Du Moulin</hi> hearing how the the Proteſtants would keep a Politick Aſſembly at <hi>Rochel</hi> againſt the King's will, judged that it was an ill conjuncture of time for him to go to <hi>Rochel,</hi> and took the way of <hi>Lions.</hi> In that reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he was guided by a good Providence; for if he had gone to <hi>Rochel,</hi> he ſhould have been apprehended not far from that Town after his coming out of it. At <hi>Lions</hi> he received a Letter from <hi>Monſieur Dre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lincourt</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Paris,</hi> which gave him notice of his danger. This warning made him baulk the high-way: yet he went to <hi>Paris,</hi> and entring the City in the night, went directly to the Lord <hi>Herbert,</hi> who bad him to flie in haſte for his life, which was in danger by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of his Letters to the King his Maſter. That very night with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out going ſo much as to his own houſe, he went out of <hi>Paris,</hi> with his Brother Captain <hi>John Du Moulin</hi> to <hi>Lumigni,</hi> a houſe of the Count <hi>de la Suze,</hi> ten Leagues from the City. Thither came two Elders of the Church of <hi>Paris</hi> to him from the Conſiſtory, to deſire him to remove himſelf out of the reach of thoſe who waited for his life. Which he did, and the next night travelled toward <hi>Sedan,</hi> a place then acknowledging the Old Duke of <hi>Bovillon</hi> (a Proteſtant Prince) for <hi>Sovereign.</hi> To <hi>Sedan</hi> he came ſafe in the beginning of the year 1621. and was kindly received by the Duke to his houſe and Table.</p>
               <p>This was his parting with the Church of <hi>Paris,</hi> where he had lived one and twenty years. And although great means were made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the Court, and albeit many years after the indictment againſt him was taken off, and leave was given him to live in <hi>France,</hi> yet was it with that exception, that he ſhould not live in <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At <hi>Sedan</hi> he was preſently deſired to accept of the place of Miniſter of that Church, and of the Chair of Divinity, then lately left by <hi>Tile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> in diſcontent, and by <hi>Andrew Melvin</hi> by death. He accepted of theſe places, but conditionally, in caſe, that he could not obtain his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution to <hi>Paris.</hi> He found at <hi>Sedan</hi> much love and reſpect from the Prince and the Academy, as alſo from the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Daniel Tilenus</hi> was a Learned man. He hath written Notes and Obſervations upon <hi>Bellarmines</hi> Diſputation, <hi>De Chriſto Capite;</hi> And on his Book <hi>De Summo Pontifice,</hi> and his Book <hi>De Verbo Dei.</hi> Other Works there are of his, as, <hi>Paraeneſis ad Scotos.

               <p>The Government of the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Saumur</hi> was continued unto <hi>Du Pleſſis,</hi> until this year 1621. when the King falling into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure and ſuſpicion of the Proteſtants, by reaſon of their high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95405:177"/> in the Aſſembly at <hi>Rochel,</hi> diſplaced him at firſt but for three Months, with a promiſe of reſtoring him ſo ſoon as affairs ſhould be quieted in ſome meaſure.

Wherefore retiring himſelf to his Houſe in the Foreſt upon <hi>Dayure,</hi> he continued there till the day of his death, which followed in the year 1623. there applying himſelf to holy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations and Exerciſes of Patience.</p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>Du Moulin</hi> having had time and occaſion whilſt he was Preſident of the Synod of <hi>Alais,</hi> and in his long journey to it and from it, to know the evil poſture of affairs, he found himſelf preſt in Spirit to write to the Aſſembly of <hi>Rochel:</hi> and becauſe that Epiſtle is a piece that giveth much light to the Hiſtory of that time, and a good leſſon to all that pretend Conſcience and Religion for their reſiſtance to their Soveraign by force of Arms, I will give ſome account of it in this place.</p>

For ſeeing the general body of the Church in eminent danger, and upon the brink of a diſmal Precipice, it was not poſſible for me to keep ſilence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It becomes me not indeed to take upon me to give Counſel to an Aſſembly of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons choſen out of the whole Kingdom to bear the burden of the publick affairs in a time ſo full of difficulty: yet I think it is uſeful for you to be truly informed what the ſenſe, and what the diſpoſition is of our Churches, by perſons that have a particular knowledge of it.</p>
                     <p>The Queſtion then being whether you ought to ſeparate your Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly to obey his Majeſty, or keep together to give order to the affairs of the Churches, I am obliged to tell you, that the general deſire of our Churches is, that it may pleaſe God to continue our peace in our obedience to his Majeſty. And that ſeeing the King reſolved to make himſelf obeyed by the force of his Arms, they truſt that you will do your beſt to avoid that ſtorm, and rather yield unto neceſſity, than to engage them in a War, which moſt certainty will ruine great part of our Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By obeying the King you ſhall take away the pretence uſed by thoſe that ſet on his Majeſty to perſecute us? And if we muſt be perſecuted, all that fear God deſire that it may be for the profeſſion of the Goſpel, and that our perſecution may truly be the croſs of Chriſt. I can aſſure you that the greateſt and beſt part
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:95405:178"/> of our Churches wiſheth for your ſeparation, if it may be with the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of your perſons: yea that many of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church deſiring the publick peace, are continually about us, beſeeching and exhorting us, that we do not by caſting our ſelves headlong involve them in the ſame ruine. Generally our poor flocks are frighted and diſmaied, caſting their eyes upon you as perſons that may procure their reſt; and by yielding to the preſent neceſſity blow away the ſtorm hanging over their heads. Many already have forſaken the Land; many have forſaken their Religion; whence you may judge what diſſipation is like to follow, if this exaſperation go on further. No more do I need to recommend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you to have a tender care of the preſervation of our poor Churches, knowing that you would chuſe death, rather than to draw that reproach upon you, that you have haſtened the perſecution of the Church, and deſtroyed that which the zeal of our Fathers had planted, and put this State in confuſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Conſider then whether the ſubſiſtence of your Aſſembly can heal all theſe ſores: whether your ſitting can give a ſhelter to our Churches, provide all things neceſſary for a War, where the parties are ſo unequal; raiſe Forces, and make a ſtock of money to pay them; whether all the good that your ſitting can produce, can countervail the diſſipation of ſo many Churches that lie open to the wrath of their enemies; whether when they are fallen you can raiſe them again; whether in the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent diviſion that is among us, you are able to rally the ſcattered parts of that divided body; which if it were well united, yet would be too weak to ſtand upon the defenſive part.</p>

                        </gap> our Proteſtants enclin'd alike to obey your reſolutions; and that the fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kindled all about, you ſhall remain helpleſs beholders of the ruine you have provoked. Neither can it be unknown to you, that many of the beſt quality among us, and beſt able to defend us, do openly blame your actions, profeſſing that ſuffering for this cauſe is not ſuffering for the cauſe of God. Theſe making no reſiſtance, and opening the Gates of their places, or joining their arms with the King's, you may eaſily judge what loſs, and what weakening of the party that will be. How many of our Nobility will forſake you, ſome out of conſcience, ſome out of treachery, ſome out of weakneſs! Even they who in an Aſſembly are moſt vehement in their votes, and to ſhew themſelves Zealous are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for violent waies, are very often they that firſt revolt and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray their Brethren. They bring our diſtreſſed Churches to the hotteſt danger and there leave them, going away after they have ſet the houſe on fire.</p>
                     <p>If there be once fighting, or beſieging of our Towns, whatſoever may the iſſue be of the Combate or the ſiege, all that while it will be hard to keep the people animated againſt us from falling upon our Churches,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:95405:178"/> that have neither retreat nor defence. And what order ſoever the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates of contrary Religion take about it, they ſhall never be able to compaſs it.</p>
                     <p>Certainly this ſtirring of yours is altogether unſeaſonable, and you ſet ſail againſt wind and tide. If any thing can help, it muſt be the zeal of Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But in this cauſe you ſhall find that zeal languiſhing, becauſe moſt of our people believe, that this evil might have been avoided without any breach to our Conſcience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When I call to mind our ſeveral loſſes, as that of <hi>Lectoure, Privas,</hi> and <hi>Bearn,</hi> I find that we our ſelves have contributed to them: and it is no wonder that our enemies take no care to remedy our faults, and join with us to do us harm. But hence it follows not, that we muſt ſet our houſe on fire our ſelves, becauſe others are reſolved to burn it; or take in hand to remedy particular loſſes by means too weak to redreſs them, but ſtrong and certain to ruine the general. God who hath ſo many times diverted the Counſels taken for our ruine, hath neither loſt his Power, nor altered his Will, we ſhall find him the ſame ſtill, if we have the grace to wait for his aſſiſtance, not caſting our ſelves headlong by our impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or ſetting our minds obſtinately upon impoſſibilities. Certainly, although our enemies ſeek our ruine, yet they will never undertake it openly without ſome pretence, other and better than that of Religion, which we muſt not give them. For if we keep our ſelves in the obedience which Subjects owe to their Sovereign, you ſhall ſee that whilſt our Enemies hope in vain that we ſhall make our ſelves guilty by ſome diſobedience, God will give them ſome other work, and afford us occaſions to ſhew to his Majeſty, that we are a Body uſeful to his State, and put him in mind of the ſignal ſervices that our Churches have done to the late King of glorious memory. But if we are ſo unfortunate, that whilſt we keep our ſelves to our duty, the calumnies of our enemies prevail; at leaſt we ſhall get ſo much, that we ſhall keep all the right on our ſide, and make it appear that we love the peace of the State.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding all this, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> you may and ought to take order for the ſafety of your perſons. For whereas his Majeſty and his Council have ſaid often, that if you ſeparate your ſelves, he will let our Churches enjoy peace, and the benefit of his Edicts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And whenſoever you Petition for your ſafe diſſolution, I truſt it will be eaſie to obtain it, if you make poſſible requeſts, and ſuch as the miſery of the time and the preſent neceſſity can bear. And in the mean time you may adviſe before you part, what ſhould be done, if notwithſtanding your ſeparation we ſhould be oppreſt. That order your prudence may find, and it is not my part to ſuggeſt it unto you.</p>

               <p>This Union and Confederacy of theirs, King <hi>Lewes</hi> uſed to call, <hi>the Common-wealth of Rochel:</hi> for the overthrow of which he alwaies proteſted, that he had only taken Arms. On the ſecond of <hi>April</hi> before he had as yet advanced into the Field, he publiſhed a Declaration in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of all thoſe of the Poteſtant Religion, which would contain themſelves within duty, and obedience. And whereas ſome of <hi>Tours</hi> at the beginning of the Wars had tumultuouſly moleſted the Proteſtants at the burial of one of their dead, five of them by the King's ſpecial Commandment were openly executed.</p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:95405:179"/>
               <p>When the War was hotteſt abroad, thoſe of the Reformed Religion at <hi>Paris</hi> lived ſecurely, and had their accuſtomed meetings at <hi>Charen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;</hi> ſo had thoſe alſo of other places. Moreover when tidings came to <hi>Paris</hi> of the Duke of <hi>Mayennes</hi> death, ſlain before <hi>Montauban,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> according to their hot-headed diſpoſition breathed out nothing but ruine to the <hi>Hugonots;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Montbazon,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the City, commanded their Houſes and the Streets to be ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Guarded. And when this Rabble had burnt down their Temple at <hi>Charenton,</hi> the Court of Parliament on the day following ordained that it ſhould be built up again in a more beautiful manner, and that at the King's charge.</p>
               <p>The forementioned Letters of Dr. <hi>Du Moulin</hi> being read in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly at <hi>Rochel,</hi> raiſed much conteſtation. In the end the violent Party prevaling, it was reſolved, that <hi>Monſieur de la Millitiere</hi> ſhould write to Dr. <hi>Du Moulin</hi> in the name of the Aſſembly, to deſire him that he would not impart the ſaid Letters unto any, and to tell him that his advice was not approved. Yet his advice was ſo reliſhed by ſome of the Aſſembly, that they aroſe, and preſently left it, and never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to it again.</p>
               <p>But the violent men in the Aſſembly did good ſervice to the Court by their violence, and were feed by the Court to thruſt their Brethren into a precipice, and give to the King the long deſired occaſion to take from the Proteſtants the places granted to them by his Father's Edict. The forenamed <hi>Millitiere</hi> was one of thoſe violent men, who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards forſook his party and his Religion; and by his working and unhappy wit he hath created much trouble unto the <hi>French</hi> Churches.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> now receives a Commiſſion from the King to march with an Army to reduce <hi>Bearn,</hi> (which the Marqueſs <hi>de la Force</hi> had excited to new Commotions) to their duty and obedience. The Marqueſs having intelligence that the Duke was coming againſt him, ſends to divert the Duke from coming into <hi>Bearn:</hi> but that not taking effect, he ſends one <hi>Charles,</hi> the principal Miniſter of <hi>Bearn</hi> unto him. This perſon in the quality of a Deputy from the Country, was ſent to repreſent to him the ſterility of the Country, the poverty of the inhabitants, and difficulty of the waies, and the reſolution of the people to make a ſmart reſiſtance, ſhould they (who were in a very good diſpoſition at preſent) be urged to the laſt extreams. But the Duke having flatly told him, that the end of his Expedition was to cauſe the King to be obeyed, and to chaſtiſe all thoſe that ſhould rebell againſt him, he was ſent back very much aſtoniſhed at ſo brisk a reply.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bearnois</hi> now gave themſelves for loſt: their high vaunts but a few daies before, that they would defend their Religion and their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:95405:180"/> liberty to the laſt man, were converted into a pannick fear; ſo that on a ſudden whole Cities were left deſolate, men of the beſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity among them, with their Wives and Children, ſeeking their ſafety in their flight, out of a juſt apprehenſion of all the puniſhments an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Prince might reaſonably inflict upon a ſtubborn and mutinous people.</p>
               <p>In this general conſternation of the <hi>Bearnois</hi> the Duke drew near to <hi>Ortez,</hi> the Caſtle whereof was very ſtrong, and had of late been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and furniſhed with all neceſſaries of War, which alſo ſhut up the paſs of the whole Country, and was of ſo advantageous a ſcituation, as was very eaſie to be defended. But thoſe within no ſooner heard that the Duke h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de la Force</hi> having intelligence of the ſurrender of <hi>Ortez,</hi> made haſte to be gone: and the Duke immediaetly advanceth from <hi>Ortez</hi> to <hi>Olleron,</hi> where ſome Fortifications had lately been made, which were alſo at his appearing deſerted, without the leaſt ſhew of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
               <p>At length the fear of the Duke's ſeverity, that had before frighted every one from his habitation, being converted into an abſolute confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his Clemency and goodneſs, every one return'd to his own home. The Cities which at his coming had been almoſt totally deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were on a ſudden re-inhabited, inſomuch that from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all the Duke had to do, was only to receive the tenders and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations of their obedience, and to ſet down Rules for their Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which were ordered with much wiſdom and juſtice. He took ſuch care to reconcile the intereſts of Religion, that both parties were ſatisfied with the equal ſhares he divided betwixt them in the publick adminiſtration. And all this was performed in leſs than three weeks time; his journey thither, his ſtay there, and his return thence, being in all not two month's expedition.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de la Force</hi> had fled from <hi>Pau</hi> in ſo great haſte, that he had left his Wardrobe, Cabinets, and Papers at random, of all which the Duke took care to have an Inventory taken, leaving them ſafe, ſeal'd up, in the cuſtody of a perſon in whom he knew the Marqueſs repoſed an entire truſt.</p>
               <p>Now the Duke retreats out of <hi>Bearn</hi> to St. <hi>Jean d'Angeli,</hi> a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Town in <hi>France.</hi> In this Town, one Mr. <hi>Welſh</hi> a <hi>Scotch</hi> man, was Preacher to the Proteſtant Church, where his Miniſtry was bleſſed with much ſucceſs. That Town had been twice beſieged: and God ſo ordered things, that the King did parley with the Town on favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable terms, and did only himſelf with his Court come into the Town without doing any violence. On the following Lord's day ſome of the Proteſtants in that place fearing Mr. <hi>Welſh</hi> his hazard, earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:95405:180"/> him not to Preach, the Court being there: but he adventured to Preach the word unto his people, and on that day had a great Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry both of friends and others; but in Sermon time a Great man of the Court, with ſome of the King's own Guard, were ſent to bring him forthwith before the King. Whilſt he was entring the Church, wherein he found ſome difficulty by reaſon of the multitude, Mr. <hi>Welſh</hi> turned himſelf towards that entry, and deſired the people to give way to one of the great Peers of <hi>France,</hi> who was coming in. But when he drew near the Pulpit to execute his Commiſſion, by putting force up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mr. <hi>Welſh,</hi> he did with great authority ſpeak to him before all the people, and in the name of his Maſter <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> charged him not to diſturb the worſhip of God; whereat the Nobleman was ſo ſtartled, that he ſate down and made no further trouble.</p>
               <p>The Sermon being ended, Mr. <hi>Welſh</hi> with much ſubmiſſion went to the King, who was then greatly incenſed; and with a threatning coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance asked what he was; and how he durſt Preach Hereſie ſo near his Perſon, and with ſuch contumacy carry himſelf. To which with due reverence bowing himſelf, he did anſwer. I am (Sir) the Servant and Miniſter of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whoſe Truth I Preached this day; which if your Majeſty rightly knew, ye would have judged it your duty to have come and heard.</p>
               <p>And for my Doctrine, I did this day Preach theſe three Truths to your people. 1. That man is fallen, and by nature in a loſt condition; yea by his own power and abilities is not able to help himſelf out of that eſtate. 2. That there is no ſalvation, or deliverance from wrath by our own merits, but by Jeſus Chriſt and his merit alone. 3. I did alſo Preach this day the juſt liberties of the Kingdom of <hi>France;</hi> that your Majeſty oweth obedience to Chriſt only, who is Head of the Church; and that the Pope, as he is an enemy to Chriſt and his Tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Whereat the King for a time keeping ſilence, with great aſtoniſhment turned to ſome about him, and ſaid, <hi>Surely this is a man of God.</hi> Yea, the King did afterwards commune with him, and with much reſpect diſmiſſed him.</p>
               <p>The year following, whilſt the differences between the King and the Proteſtant party did grow, the City was again beſieged, taken, and in part ſacked, as Mr. <hi>Welſh</hi> had publickly foretold; at which time t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> having now received the Command of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, ſets down before <hi>Rochel</hi> at the end of <hi>July:</hi> but the taking of this City was reſerved for the King himſelf.</p>

               <p>Whilſt the Duke lay before <hi>Rochel,</hi> the King had with extraordinary vigour proſecuted his deſigns in <hi>Guinne,</hi> where he had compell'd moſt of the places poſſeſſed by the Proteſtants in that Province to ſubmit to his Power. He had reduced <hi>Berg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Winter being ſcarce over, <hi>Monſieur Soubize</hi> having fortified himſelf in the Iſle of <hi>Reé,</hi> and ſome other Iſlands of <hi>Poictou,</hi> thought the difficulty of their acceſs would protect him from the Royal power: but the King paſſed over the mariſhes, and gave him ſo notable a defeat, that he could not of a long time after recover that blow, nor put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf again into any tolerable poſture of War.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the year 1622. the Count of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> had the charge of the Army which lay before <hi>Rochel,</hi> conferred upon him: and the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> is ſent to lay ſiege to <hi>Royan,</hi> which is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle City built upon a very high Rock by the Sea ſide, inacceſſible on that ſide toward the water, the height whereof breaking off the impetuoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the winds, at the foot of the Precipice affordeth a very ſecure harbour to ſo many veſſels as it could contain. This harbour was defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by an ancient Caſtle rais'd upon the eminence of the Rock; and in the midſt of it a litle way was levell'd, that led to the harbour by one of the Gates of the City. On that ſide toward the Land the ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation was more even, but there alſo ſo well Fortified, that it was thought to be one of the moſt tenable places for its Circuit in <hi>France.</hi> And it was almoſt without danger to be defended, foraſmuch as after their outworks ſhould be taken (which could not be till after a long ſiege) the convenience of the Sea, and the vicinity of <hi>Rochel,</hi> rendered their retreat at any time ſo eaſie and ſo ſecure that it was to be defended to the laſt extream.</p>
               <p>But by the Dukes admirable Conduct, and the valour of his Souldiers, this place was in a few weeks reduced to the King's obedience.</p>
               <p>The King's Army now marcheth into <hi>Guienne,</hi> where at his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties arrival he found <hi>Monravet</hi> taken by the Duke <hi>d'Elboeuf;</hi> and <hi>Themeins</hi> after a long and obſtinate reſiſtance ſurrendered to the ſame Duke. <hi>Le Mont de Marſan</hi> with ſeveral other conſiderable places were alſo reduced to his obedience by the Marqueſs <hi>de la Force, de Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignan,</hi> and <hi>de Caſtelnau de Chaloſſe,</hi> who had taken them in.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty paſſed ſpeedily from <hi>Guienne</hi> into <hi>Languedoc. Nigri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poliſſe,</hi> a little Town of <hi>Queren</hi> upon his way, was ſo impudent as to ſtand a ſiege; but it was ſoon taken by aſſault, and there the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ſhewed the very rigour of ſeverity, which either a barbarous Victor
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:95405:181"/> could inflict, or a vanquiſhed people ſuffer: for they ſpared neither man, woman, nor child, all equally ſubject to the cruelty of the ſword and the Conquerour: the Streets paved with dead carkaſſes; the channels running with the blood of Chriſtians; no noiſe in the Streets but of ſuch as were welcoming death, or ſuing for life. And when the Souldiers had made the Women the ſubjects of their luſts, they made them after the ſubjects of their fury: in this only pitiful to that poor and diſtreſſed Sex, that they ſuffered them not to ſurvive their honours. Such of them who out of fear and faintneſs had made but little reſiſtance, had the favour to be ſtabbed: but thoſe whoſe vertue and courage maintain'd their bodies va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly from the rape of thoſe villains, had the ſecrets of nature filled with Gun-powder, and ſo blown into aſhes. St. <hi>Antonin</hi> having after a ſiege ſurrendered to mercy, the neighbouring places thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to flie to the King's Clemency, to evade the trial of his victorious Arms.</p>
               <p>Then the King beſiegeth <hi>Montpelier,</hi> and after much blood ſpilt the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> was glad to make uſe of a juncture wherein his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had ſome little advantage, to procure a more favourable peace, which was accordingly ſigned before <hi>Montpelier, October</hi> 22. 1622. and <hi>Calonges</hi> ſurrendred up the place to his Majeſtie's hand, who if he had by his courage won himſelf a great reputation in the ſiege, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained no leſs by his ingenuity in the handſom manner of his ſubmiſſion to the King. The King made his entrance into the City, and having taken order for the defence of the City, he returned towards <hi>Paris:</hi> and in the year 1623. the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> arrives at <hi>Paris</hi> with a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous train, where he was received by the King and the Queens with great kindneſs. All his accompts, and the other affairs that moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired his preſence at <hi>Paris,</hi> were in leſs than four Months diſpatched, ſo that toward the latter end of <hi>April</hi> in the year 1624. he began to think of his return into <hi>Guienne.</hi>

               <p>Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> was after his departure made Prime Miniſter of State, who ſoon ſhews himſelf to be oppoſite to the Duke.</p>

All the reſt of the party broke into Arms at the ſame time, and the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who had long been known to be the Head of that party, ſtirred them into inſurrection. A promptitude in his Partizans ſo much the more to be wondered at, as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a ſort of people whoſe obedience was only voluntary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montauban</hi> was one of the Cities not only of <hi>Guienne,</hi> but alſo of the whole Kingdom, that engaged the deepeſt in this revolt, the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:95405:182"/> whereof by having had a ſiege raiſed from before their Walls, and by having baffled a Royal Army, even when animated by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the King himſelf, began to think themſelves invincible, and their City a place not to be taken.</p>
               <p>The King therefore ſent order to the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> to take Arms, which he did, and laid waſte the Country about <hi>Montauban.</hi> Many ſmart engagements there were, with great loſs of men on the ſide of the beſieged, who made a vigorous reſiſtance.

                  <hi>Soubize</hi> in the mean time endeavours to divert the Duke from his enterprize by Landing three thouſand five hundred Foot, and ſome few Horſe in the lower <hi>Gaſcony</hi> in the Country of <hi>Medoc.</hi> This lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Country (which is almoſt all the Duke's) environs a great part of the Metropolis of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> extending it ſelf to the very Gates of the City: but <hi>Soubize</hi> was ſhamefully repulſed; his Forces routed; the few that eſcaped the Victors hands with much ado recovered their Ships, leaving their dead, their Arms, Artillery and Baggage, as infallible teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of a total defeat.</p>
               <p>About the year 1623. the famous Book of Cardinal <hi>Du Perron</hi> againſt King <hi>James</hi> of famous memory, came forth. That Book was extolled by the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> with great brags and praiſes. His Majeſty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſpecially intereſſed and provoked by that Book, was pleaſed to recommend the confutation of it to his old Champion Dr. <hi>Du Moulin,</hi> who undertook it upon his Majeſties Command. And that he might attend that work with more help and leiſure, his Majeſty invited him to come into <hi>England.</hi> And together being moved with compaſſion by the adverſities the Doctor had ſuffered for his ſake, he offered him a refuge in <hi>England,</hi> promiſing to take care of him, and to employ him in one of his Univerſities. He accepted that Royal favour. He ſet out of <hi>Sedan</hi> in <hi>March</hi> 1624. and went to <hi>Bruxels</hi> and <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Holland:</hi> whence after ſome daies ſtay at the <hi>Hague</hi> with his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Brother in law Doctor <hi>Rivet,</hi> he took Shipping for <hi>England.</hi> He was graciouſly received by his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>God viſited him with a grievous ſickneſs, by an heavy oppreſſion in his Hypochondries, with an inflammation of black choler, which ſeldom let him ſleep, and kept him in perpetual agony. Yet even then he ſpent much time in his great work againſt Cardinal <hi>Du Perron,</hi> and preached often in the <hi>French</hi> Church. In the depth of his pain and anguiſh he
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:95405:182"/> was beyond meaſure afflicted with the perſecutions that ruined the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>France,</hi> and the diviſions then increaſing in the Churches of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was at <hi>London</hi> at that time the Marqueſs <hi>d'Effiat,</hi>

                  </note> extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Ambaſſadour of <hi>France,</hi> a zealous Papiſt, who upon a falſe infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of <hi>Fiſher</hi> and other Jeſuites that were about him, that Doctor <hi>Du Moulin</hi> by his long watchings and other melancholy fumes, was decayed in his Intellectuals, did malitiouſly invite him to his houſe, to engage him in a Conference, and inſult over his weakneſs. After dinner the Ambaſſadour deſired him to hear a <hi>Scottiſh</hi> man, who would tell him the reaſons that made him leave the Proteſtant Religion to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Catholick. The <hi>Scottiſh</hi> man then aſſiſted by <hi>Fiſher,</hi> and others of his ſort, made an elaborate Diſcourſe half an hour long of the Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Primacy, of ſucceſſion of Chairs, and the like. When he had done, the Doctor reſumed all his points and allegations in the ſame order, and anſwered them with his ordinary vigour, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of wit. And becauſe the principal matter in queſtion was about the Marks of the true Church, he maintained that the Profeſſion of the true Doctrine was the Mark of the true Church: and thence took occaſion to lay open the foulneſs of the errors of Popery with ſo much pregnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that the Ambaſſadour a Cholerick man, roſe from his ſeat in great fury, and gave many foul words to the Doctor, who thereupon went out and returned home.</p>
               <p>But the Ambaſſadour ſent his Coach to him the next day, and invited him to dinner. And after dinner the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> man ſpake again of the ſame points: and when the Doctor in his anſwer had turned his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute againſt the groſſeſt errours of Popery, incompatible with the true Church, <hi>Fiſher</hi> would have taken the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> man's part: but the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour's paſſion gave him no time to anſwer, but broke vehemently out, ſaying, that he could hear no longer that one ſhould revile before him the Catholick Religion, and maintain to him that he did wilfully damn himſelf, his Wife and his Children. Then the Doctor went out of his houſe.</p>
               <p>Soon after King <hi>James</hi> fell ſick of the Sickneſs whereof he died.

So he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his former Function in the Church and Univerſity, ſerving God with chearfulneſs and aſſiduity, and bleſſed with great ſucceſs. He lived at <hi>Sedan</hi> thirty and three years from his return into <hi>England</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:95405:183"/> unto his death, without any notable change in his condition, but one of publick concernment by the miſerable change of the Duke of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Duke being Prince of <hi>Sedan,</hi> the Protectour of a flouriſhing Proteſtant Church, and the refuge of many oppreſſed Proteſtants in <hi>France,</hi> was perverted by falling in love with a beautiful Lady, a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject born of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and a Papiſt of the deepeſt Jeſuitiſh dye, which ſeduced and turned him both to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, and to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Party. Soon after the Duke declared himſelf a Papiſt, to the incredible loſs of the Proteſtant Party.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sedan</hi> was grown by the perſecutions in <hi>France.</hi> The greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and the richeſt ſort, conſiſted of the Poſterity of perſons that had tranſported their Families and their Eſtates to <hi>Sedan,</hi> during the Wars of Religion; and that place was a refuge at hand for the Proteſtants when any trouble aroſe in <hi>France.</hi> This change therefore in the Prince wrought a great conſternation in the people of <hi>Sedan,</hi> and a great grief in the generality of all the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants. Which the Duke of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villon</hi> perceiving; and judging, that as they lived at <hi>Sedan</hi> upon the account of their Religion, they might retire from it upon the ſame account, he called the Church and the Univerſity, and told them, that he would lend them the ſame Protection as before, and innovate nothing. Only where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he gathered the Tythes of his Dominions, and therewith gave wages to the Miniſters, Profeſſours, and Regents, as alſo Stipends to the Prieſts; now the Prieſts muſt have the Tythes as their ancient right, and he would pay to the Miniſters, Profeſſours, and Regents, their ordinary Stipends out of his own Eſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sedan</hi> enjoyed that reſt for a year or two, till the Duke won by his Wife to forſake the Protection which he enjoyed under the King of <hi>France</hi> who paid his Garriſon, agreed with the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to put himſelf under his Protection, to turn out the <hi>French</hi> Garriſon and receive his: Which Plot being diſcovered by ſome of <hi>Sedan,</hi> was made known to the <hi>French</hi> Court, and ſuch order was taken, that the Duke's deſign was prevented, Himſelf, his Lady, and all his Retinue, were turned out of <hi>Sedan,</hi> and are kept out of it to this day, and the place continueth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſubjection of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This year the Inhabitants of the <hi>Valtoline</hi> were much diſtreſſed. The <hi>Valtoline</hi> is a Country ſcituate at the foot of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> not unlike a great ditch, ſeparated by the high Mountains from the <hi>Griſons,</hi>

The <hi>Venetians</hi> were not ignorant of it, when they were embroiled with Pope <hi>Paul</hi> V. <hi>Anno</hi> 1603. They made a
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:95405:183"/> League with the <hi>Griſons,</hi> who are natural L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Which Alliance with them gives great offence to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which cauſed them to make another League with the <hi>Griſons,</hi> to whom the ſame paſſages were aſſured for the ſafeguard of <hi>Milan.</hi> But after a long Treaty made in the year 1613. theſe two new Alliances were overthrown, and that of <hi>France</hi> re-ſetled, which was not for any long time: for from the year 1617. to the year 1621. there were nine inſurrections among them. At laſt the <hi>Valtolines</hi> made a general revolt, and at the perſwaſion of the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> maſſacred all the Proteſtants they met with. In <hi>July</hi> 1620. the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> ſent them Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and builded them Forts in their Valley.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> King then being engaged in re-taking thoſe Towns which the <hi>Hugonots</hi> had gotten into their poſſeſſion, could not ſuccour the <hi>Griſons</hi> with his Armies, but ſent the Marſhal <hi>de Baſſompiere,</hi> extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Ambaſſadour into <hi>Spain,</hi> in his name to demand that the <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toline</hi> might be reſtored, and all things replaced into their former ſtate. It was obtained, and accordingly it was ſigned at <hi>Madrid</hi> in <hi>May</hi> 1621. on condition that certain great liberties might be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Catholicks there; and with a Proviſo, that the <hi>Cantons</hi> of the <hi>Swiſſes</hi> and the <hi>Valtolines</hi> ſhould encline the <hi>Griſons</hi> to conſent, to what had been agreed upon.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> procured the Catholick <hi>Cantons</hi> to deny their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, which being wanting they would put off the execution of the whole Treaty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and moreover made one at <hi>Milan</hi> with the Deputies of the <hi>Griſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and unto others with the ſame <hi>Griſons</hi> and the Arch-Duke <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pold,</hi> by which they got great advantages in thoſe Countries, and ſo kept to themſelves the power of paſſing any Forces through that Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>France</hi> never made any difficulty of according to any thing which might contribute to the exerciſe of the Catholick Religion in the <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toline,</hi> or for ſecurity of all ſuch as made profeſſion thereof. But they would never agree to thoſe demands which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the having of paſſages, with ſo much peremptorineſs. During which time Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> XV. died, and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. being ſet in his place, propoſed new Articles of Accommodation, which compriſed as much as could be of advantage for the Church and Catholicks, which were readily accepted of by <hi>France,</hi> but as ſtoutly rejected by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> for that it did not grant to them the enjoyment of the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Then Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> adviſed the King not to ſtand dallying upon the means of a Treaty, as formerly, but forthwith to make uſe
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:95405:184"/> of his Arms to reduce t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>m to terms of juſtice. The King reſolves to ſend the Marqueſs <hi>de Coenures</hi> to the <hi>Cantons</hi> of the <hi>Swiſſes</hi> for the <hi>Griſons</hi> affairs, at the ſame time that the <hi>Sieur de Bethune</hi> was diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed toward <hi>Rome.</hi> His inſtructions were; firſt to re-unite all the <hi>Swiſſe Cantons</hi> with his Majeſty, to diſpoſe the Catholicks to give their aſſent to the Treaty of <hi>Madrid,</hi> and to eſpie, if in this re-union there might not ſome way be found out, for to re-place the Garriſons into the Soveraignty of the <hi>Valtoline.</hi> The ſecond was to be kept private if the firſt took effect; elſe he was commanded to encourage the <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> to riſe, who ſhould receive aſſiſtance from his Majeſty, of ſuch Troops as ſhould be neceſſary, according to ſuch orders as ſhould be received.</p>
               <p>Then the <hi>French</hi> King, Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and Common-wealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> made a League for the reſtitution of the <hi>Valto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de Coenures</hi> takes the field to make himſelf Maſter of the Forts in the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> which were all taken in the three firſt Months of the following year. New Orders are ſent to the Marqueſs to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute his Conqueſts there. The Pope ſeems to the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> and the <hi>Sieur de Bethune,</hi> to be very angry that the King ſhould attempt upon the Forts in the <hi>Valtoline</hi> which were in his keeping, and ſends the <hi>Sieur Bernardino Nary</hi> to his Majeſty, to teſtifie to him his great diſcontent at it</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi> to break the League between the <hi>French</hi> King, the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> negotiates another between himſelf and the Princes of <hi>Italy.</hi> The <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſpreads abroad defaming Libels againſt the League of <hi>France, Venice,</hi> and <hi>Savoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe great loſſes which the Proteſtants had ſuſtained for ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding years in <hi>Bearn</hi> and <hi>Languedoc,</hi> alwaies kept them waking, eſpecially after the Peace of <hi>Montpelier;</hi> they well perceiving, that thoſe ſmall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>outs which they had ſuffered, did threaten their Party with an utter deſtruction.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> therefore laboured very much to get the <hi>Sieur de Soubize</hi> and <hi>Rohan</hi> (who were the only eminent perſons) to Command their Arms. Their deſign took effect. Theſe two Brothers being met at <hi>Caſtres,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to raiſe thoſe of their Party; the one by Sea at <hi>Guienne,</hi> and the other in <hi>Languedoc.</hi> The attempt upon the Fort of <hi>Blavet</hi> (otherwiſe Port S. <hi>Lewes</hi>) of which we have ſpoken before, was an effect of that reſolution, as alſo the endeavours of the Duke and Ducheſs of <hi>Rohan</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at the ſame time in <hi>Languedoc</hi> to draw in more Towns in to their Party.</p>
               <p>But the Marqueſs <hi>de Ragny</hi> was ſent in all haſte into <hi>Languedoc</hi> with certain Regiments to oppoſe the firſt Commotions; and to employ many perſons of diſcretion to aſſure himſelf of the Counſels of the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:95405:184"/> chief Towns, and by this means moſt of them kept within their duties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Soubize</hi> publiſht a Manifeſt, which ſounded an Alarm to all the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Party, making them to believe that their utter ruine was concluded on in the King's Council. That the loſs of their Religion was inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, if they did not defend themſelves by Arms: and that the raiſing of Fort Saint <hi>Lewes</hi> built by <hi>Rochel,</hi> was a ſign of it. He ſuggeſted to them, that the Catholicks were of opinion in moſt of their Bcoks, that they were not obliged to keep Faith with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</p>
               <p>Moſt were taken with theſe reaſons, becauſe the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> clapt into ſome Towns certain Gentlemen and Captains of his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to encourage them, and to ſtir up the Popular Miniſters, who after this looked for nothing but when to riſe; not conſidering that the inſurrections which they were carried to, were contrived by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> who pretended not to make uſe of them, but only to divert and draw off the King's Arms from <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That fomentation which the <hi>Spaniard</hi> gave to the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to force the King to draw off his Army from the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> obliged the <hi>French</hi> King to do the like by the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in aſſaulting the Common-wealth of <hi>Genoa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Pope ſends the Cardinal <hi>Barbarino</hi> in the quality of a Legate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France,</hi> to negotiate the Peace between the <hi>French</hi> King and the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Hugonots</hi> by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> inſtigation arm themſelves very potently againſt the <hi>French</hi> King. The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> took the Command upon himſelf of thoſe Forces in <hi>Languedoc, Soubize</hi> thoſe in <hi>Poictou.</hi> Although <hi>Soubize</hi> had been repulſed from before the Port of <hi>Blavet,</hi> yet by that means he made himſelf maſter of ſix great Ships which were the King's, and the Duke's of <hi>Nemours,</hi> which gave him opportunity of doing very conſiderable damages.</p>
               <p>He had formerly got together about eleven Ships of War, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Shallops and ſmall Boats, and with theſe roved up and down the Coaſts of <hi>Poictou</hi> and <hi>Guienne,</hi> as hath been before hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> got together about two thouſand men near <hi>Caſtres.</hi> He gave out that the <hi>Rochellers</hi> had taken Arms, and ſworn a League with the Churches of his Party, that he might by this pretence get a like intereſt in ſome other Towns which he had an eye upon. And accordingly he went to <hi>Puilaurens, Ruel, Soreze,</hi> St. <hi>Pauls, Leviate,</hi> and <hi>Briteſte,</hi> and made the Conſuls ſwear to the Confederacy; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he came to the Gates of <hi>Lavaur</hi> to ſurpr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Count of <hi>Carmain</hi> Governour of <hi>Foix</hi> got into <hi>Ruel</hi> and <hi>Soreze,</hi> after the other had forſaken them, and ſo dealt with the Conſuls, that they confeſſed their faults, and proteſted not to take part with him any more. A Proceſs was made in the Parliament of <hi>Tholouſe</hi> againſt him and all his Adherents.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de Cragny</hi> and the Count of <hi>Carmain</hi> marched againſt the Duke: and whilſt thoſe who made the firſt Encounter were at it; the reſt got into <hi>Vianes,</hi> who were however ſo cloſely purſued by the Marſhal's Forces, that the Regiment of <hi>Normandy</hi> was hard at their heels, entring into the Town with them. Thus he remained Maſter of <hi>Peyreſquade,</hi> where there were about one hundred and fifty of the Rebels Souldiers killed and hurt; all which the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> beheld from a Fort in <hi>Vianes</hi> where he then was, from which time forwards he began to deſpair of doing any great matters for the future, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſince he ſaw himſelf ſo cloſely followed; and that the Cardinal had taken ſuch a courſe in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> that the King could have raiſed more men in twenty four hours than the Duke in a whole month.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Soubize</hi> finding little aſſurance on the main Land, had fortified himſelf in the Iſles of <hi>Reé</hi> and <hi>Olleron:</hi> it was the more important to remove him thence, becauſe otherwiſe it would be impoſſible to reduce <hi>Rochel</hi> unto its obedience, ſo eaſily and abundantly might he recruit them with neceſſaries from thoſe fertile Iſlands: but the Duke of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency</hi> the King's Admiral made himſelf Maſter of the Iſle of <hi>Reé,</hi> after a three daies Combate with a great deal of obſtinacy on both parts. The Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> Landed at <hi>Olleron,</hi> where he met with no reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sieur de Soubize</hi> haying withdrawn himſelf into <hi>England,</hi> lived at a Houſe called <hi>Burgate</hi> in <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> near the New Foreſt, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers years after.

He is bound by the Laws of the Kingdom, before he officiate the Function of a Legate, to preſent the Brief which the Pope hath given him for the employment to the Parliament of <hi>Paris.</hi> The Pope having omitted in this Brief to give the King the title of King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> the Parliament refuſed to acknowledge it, and obliged him not to proceed any further in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs till that were amended.</p>
               <p>The Legate coming to <hi>Paris,</hi> alighted at St. <hi>James de Haut-pas,</hi> where the Clergy of the City, the concourſe of the Court, and other Officers

After this the Prelates of <hi>Paris</hi> came to pay their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to him. There was a little diſpute in what habit they ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before him, the Legate deſiring they ſhould be in their Rochets and Camall covered over with a Mantlet, as a mark that they had no power in his preſence. But the Prelates refuſing to ſtoop to this Order, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to the Rules of the <hi>French</hi> Church, took a middle courſe. They went ſo habited to ſalute him, and accordingly accompanied him in the <hi>Cavalcade</hi> to <hi>Noſtre-Dame,</hi> whither being come, they took off their Mantlets: but all was done under a Proviſo, of ſaving their anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent right.</p>
               <p>He propoſed to the King what the Pope had given him in charge.</p>
               <p>He urged the King in general terms to peace; to reſtore things in the <hi>Valtoline</hi> to their former ſtate, as they were before the Army of the Confederate Princes entred into it, and deſired him to grant a Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Arms in <hi>Italy.</hi>

               <p>The King anſwered to the three Propoſitions, That he was ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to Peace, and that he would ſtill be induced to it, provided it were for the publick ſafety, and honourable for him and his Allies.

As to the Ceſſation of Arms, that he could by no means hearken to it, becauſe of the great prejudice it would be to himſelf and his Allies, and the great advantage thoſe of the adverſe Party might make out of it.

               <p>Theſe favours were accepted by the general Deputies of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in the name of all their Towns, excepting thoſe of <hi>Rochel, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauban, Caſtres,</hi> and <hi>Milhaud,</hi> who having been gained by the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> and <hi>Sieur de Soubize;</hi> and finding that their Leaders had obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only a ſingle Pardon, without any other advantage, and without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing employ'd in <hi>Italy,</hi> according as they deſired, they entreated his Majeſty upon other pretences, that he would be pleaſed to grant ſome time, till their two chief Officers, and thoſe four Cities, were joyned with them. The King granted to them that delay, upon condition it were not over long, who preſently ſent away the heads of thoſe reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which had been taken.</p>
               <p>But the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> excuſeth himſelf from accepting thoſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which were granted to thoſe of his Party. He did his utmoſt to ſurprize ſome places in <hi>Languedoc.</hi> He made an attempt upon <hi>Tillet</hi> in <hi>Albigeois.</hi> He had ſome time before cauſed the Towns of <hi>Maſdazil, Pamiers,</hi> and ſeveral other of <hi>Foix,</hi> to revolt, from which places he ſent out his Scouts, who committed great havocks in the plain Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. But the Marſhal <hi>de Themines,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Carmain</hi> fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> charged and killed many of them, and took divers places from them, ſome by ſtorm, ſome by compoſition. Hereupon the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> went to the Aſſembly at <hi>Milhaud,</hi> where he made thoſe of his Party ſend a Currier to the King, to accept of the Articles of Peace which his Majeſty had granted to them. His Majeſty confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, though they had rendered themſelves unworthy by their new Acts of Rebellion. But it was neceſſary ſo to be, for the better oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the enterprizes of <hi>Spain,</hi> though <hi>Rochel</hi> was ſtill excepted, by reaſon of the little inclination they had teſtified of keeping themſelves within their duty.</p>
               <p>Then the Biſhops and Clergy of <hi>France</hi> aſſembled at <hi>Paris.</hi> The chief intent of their meeting was for the renewing of that Contract which they made every tenth year with the King, for the payment of thoſe Rents which are impoſed on them. They alſo condemned certain Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels ſent abroad by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ambition, which had been ſent into <hi>France.</hi> They condemned the Authours of them as enemies to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick quiet, and ſeducers of the people to Sedition. And they granted to the King Six hundred thouſand crowns upon the Churches o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>France,</hi> as a Contribution toward the Wars in which the State was engaged,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:95405:186"/> as alſo to preſerve the Catholick Religion in its ſplendour, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the glory of the Crown.</p>
               <p>But many ſordid ſpirits grudged at it, who conſidering but one of thoſe ends for which Lands were given to Churches, began to oppoſe it; as if the Church (which is part of the State) were not bound to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the good of thoſe Corporations of which they were members; and as if the publick neceſſities were not more conſiderable than the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate profits of ſome particular people, who often employ their Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to bad uſes.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal now endeavoureth the procuring of Peace for thoſe of <hi>Rochel.</hi> And the ſame reaſons which enclined his Majeſty to ſhew his Clemency to the reſt of that party, did alſo perſwade him to do the like to thoſe of <hi>Rochel.</hi> The King conſented that the Town ſhould be delivered into the hands of the Corporation, on condition that they kept no Ships of War: that they obſerved thoſe Orders for traffique which were eſtabliſhed in the reſt of the Kingdom. That they ſhould reſtore to the Eccleſiaſticks all the goods which had been taken from them. That they ſhould ſuffer the Catholicks to live freely and quietly in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion, and in the enjoyment of thoſe goods which appertained to them. That his Majeſty ſhould leave what Garriſon he thought fit in Fort <hi>Lewes,</hi> and the Iſlands of <hi>Reé</hi> and <hi>Olle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> only promiſing, that he would ſettle ſuch a courſe in it, as thoſe of <hi>Rochel</hi> might receive no trouble by it, either in their Commerce, or in the enjoyment of their goods. Theſe Articles were agreed on about the beginning of <hi>February,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1626.</note> and the next day the General and particular Deputies ratified and confirmed them.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Lewes</hi> made a ſevere Edict againſt Duels, and took a ſolemn Oath not to ſhew any favour to thoſe who ſhould break it.</p>
               <p>About this time there aroſe very great Diſputes in the Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> eſpecially between the Doctors of Divinity, about a certain Book compoſed by <hi>Sanctarellus</hi> a Jeſuite, which treated of the power Popes had over Kings: which Book had been approved by their chief Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, by the Pope's Vicegerent, and by the Maſter of the holy Palace.</p>
               <p>His Doctrine was, That Popes had a power of direction, or rather correction over Princes, that they might not only Excommunicate them, but deprive them of their Kingdoms too, and abſolve their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from their Oaths of Allegiance, whether it were for Hereſie, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie, or any other great publick crime; whether it were for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of their perſons, or for their not defending the Church, and that the Pope might at laſt give their States to ſuch as he ſhould think fit.</p>
               <p>For the preſent it made a great noiſe among the Doctors, and was oppoſed by ſeveral Books which then were publiſhed. The whole
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95405:187"/> Body of Divines did condemn it: ſome indeed of the old League ſeemed to favour it. But the Parliament called the chief of the Jeſuites before them, and obliged them to ſign a Declaration, by which they ſhould condemn the ſaid Book; and to cauſe another of the like to be ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by all the Provincials and Rectors, and by Six of the moſt ancient of every one of their Colledges in <hi>France;</hi> and ſo ordered the Book to be burnt by the common Hangman, with prohibition to the <hi>Stationers</hi> to ſell any of them.</p>
               <p>At this time there were Combinations of divers Grandees of the Court againſt the King and State. <hi>Madam de Chevuruſe</hi> being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented that her private intelligences with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſadour were ſo publickly taken notice of, did not a little promote the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, by her animating of <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Grand Prior, and <hi>Chalais,</hi> to execute it, both which were engaged by love to her; as alſo that the Colonel <hi>d'Ornano</hi> abuſing <hi>Monſieur</hi>'s goodneſs, and the credit which his place gave him, did abſolutely divert him from the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ge which his Majeſty had ſo earneſtly deſired ſhould be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal diſcovered, that <hi>Chalais</hi> was one of chief Inſtruments of the Enterprize, and that Colonel <hi>Ornano</hi> was the Ring-leader of the Plot. That their chief end was to unite all the Provinces ſo cloſe together, that they might enforce his Majeſty not to remove any thing from the Court, and withal to permit them to live in the ſame licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that they had a long while formerly enjoyed. That to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, they endeavoured the breaking of the match between <hi>Monſieur</hi> and <hi>Madamoiſelle de Montpenſier,</hi> and to bring on that of <hi>Madamoiſelle de Bourbon,</hi> which would more nearly engage <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur</hi> to their Intereſts; or elſe to perſuade him to marry ſome other ſtranger Princeſs, which might be a means to ſhelter and defend their deſigns, by the forces and aſſiſtances, which they might reaſonably expect from ſuch a Family. That this once effected, they intended the Count <hi>de Soiſſons</hi> ſhould Marry <hi>Madamoiſelle de Montpenſier,</hi> that the Houſes of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and <hi>Bourbon</hi> might be united together, and in this manner they would in a moment huddle up together all the leading po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent perſons of the Court.</p>
               <p>The Marſhal <hi>de Ornano</hi> is arreſted at <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> and carried Priſoner to the Caſtle of <hi>Bois de Vincennes,</hi> where he died a few months after of a ſtoppage in his Bladder.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal beſeecheth the King to permit his retirement from the Court. And the King cauſeth the Duke <hi>de Vendoſm,</hi> and the <hi>Grand-Prior</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> his Brother, to be impriſoned at <hi>Blois.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Marriage of <hi>Monſieur</hi> and <hi>Madamoiſelle de Montpenſier</hi> was celebrated ſoon after to the quiet and content of the whole Kingdom.</p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:95405:187"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chalais,</hi> the Maſter of the King's Wardrobe, is arreſted from the Chamber of Juſtices at <hi>Nantes,</hi> who condemned him of Treaſon, and ſentenced him to be beheaded; which was done accordingly. Then was the <hi>Sieur de Baradas</hi> removed from the Court, who had been much in favour with the King.</p>
               <p>About the end of this year great differences aroſe between the Biſhop and the Officers of <hi>Verdun.</hi> This being a Frontier Town, was then lookt upon as conſiderable, in regard <hi>Monſieur de Lorrain</hi> ſeemed to be active, and able to attempt ſomething upon <hi>France,</hi> which obliged the King to go on with a deſign which he had long before reſolved of, the building a Citadel there.</p>
               <p>The Abbey of S. <hi>Vannes</hi> was ever reputed the moſt fit place of all the City for that purpoſe: whence it happened, that in the Charter of the ſaid Abbey there had been divers Articles concluded between the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Verdun</hi> and thoſe to whom that place hath ever belonged, in which they bound themſelves to build their Church in ſome other place, if it ſhould be found neceſſary to make uſe of ſome part of it for the raiſing of a Citadel. However the lines were ſo contrived, that the Church was ſaved: but that of the Capuchins was forced to be taken down, which was afterwards done, and rebuilt in another place.</p>
               <p>Now the Biſhop of <hi>Verdun</hi> being <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s kinſman, was wholly moved by him; ſo that not conſidering what dependence he had upon the King, he ſuffered himſelf to be engaged by the Duke, to prevent the building of the Citadel. On <hi>December</hi> 30. he publiſhed a <hi>Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torium,</hi> fixed upon all publick places, againſt all ſuch as ſhould labour about it. This proceeding was lookt on as a ſtrange thing by the King's Officers.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sieur Guillet</hi> preſently called a Council of his Majeſties Officers of the Town, to conſider of what was to be done, where it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to tear down ſuch Papers as had been any where poſted up, and to ſet others in their places of a contrary tenour in the King's behalf, which was preſently done. The Biſhop offended at it, thundered out an Excommunication the next day againſt <hi>Guillet,</hi> which he faſtened in divers places: and having given order to his Vicars not to act any thing in prejudice to his pretended authority, he departed from <hi>Verdun,</hi> and rode Poſt to <hi>Cologne.</hi> In the mean while the <hi>Sieur Charpentier</hi> his Majeſties Preſident in <hi>Metz, Thoul,</hi> and <hi>Verdun,</hi> being acquainted with the whole proceeding, he declared the ſaid <hi>Monitorium</hi> to be abuſive and ſcandalous, and commanded it to be torn and burnt by the Hangman. That the ſaid Biſhop ſhould be ſent Priſoner to <hi>Paris.</hi> That his Benefices in the mean time ſhould remain in his Majeſties hands, and that he ſhould pay a fine of ten thouſand livres for his ſaid fault. This Judgement was put in execution with the uſual form, excepting only as to the Biſhop's being ſent to <hi>Paris;</hi> ſo that he reſolving not to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:95405:188"/> ſuffer himſelf to be thus deſpoiled of his goods, thought it his beſt courſe to ſend to the King to pacifie him, for his raſhneſs: he alſo gave order to one of his Vicars to abſolve the <hi>Sieur Guillet,</hi> and to licence the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of the Fortifications.</p>
               <p>In the year 1627. thoſe of <hi>Rochel,</hi> could not endure to ſee the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Peace which the King had accorded to them, put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: they could not permit that the Rules of Commerce obſerved over all <hi>France,</hi> ſhould be taken notice of among them. The cutting off of that abſolute authority which they had made uſe of in the Iſles of <hi>Reé</hi> and <hi>Olleron,</hi> and other places bordering upon their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, was looked on as an outrage. The exerciſe of the Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion amongſt them, was eſteemed as a great ſlavery, and a rigorous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint impoſed upon that whereof they made Profeſſion. They complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of thoſe Souldiers in Fort <hi>Lewes,</hi> and the Iſles of <hi>Reé,</hi> and <hi>Olleron,</hi> left there only to prevent their relapſing into their former inſolencies, as a moſt unſufferable Tyranny. They reſented his Majeſtie's Commiſſaries Acts in order to the execution of the Treaty, as ſo many unjuſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts upon their Liberties. With theſe complaints they filled their Manifeſts.</p>
               <p>They made uſe of theſe Motives to perſwade the reſt of the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Towns to revolt, to form themſelves into a Common-wealth, and to obtain that by force from the King, which with juſtice they could not expect.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> diſcontented for that he had made no advantage by the Peace, did not a little foment thoſe Mutinies of the <hi>Rochellers;</hi> to which end he under-hand ſowed diviſions among the Conſuls of the chief <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonot</hi> Towns in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and ſome he made for his own Party, but his deſign took little effect in thoſe parts.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> King animated by the ſage Counſels of Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> reſolves on the ſiege of <hi>Rochel,</hi> and from that time forwards preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were made in all the adjacent Provinces of Warlike Ammunitions, great ſtore of Cannon were ſent before-hand towards the place, that they might be in readineſs when time ſhould ſerve. Divers means were thought on, to block up the Channel, and to begin with thoſe of leſs charge to prevent greater expences, in caſe they might do the work. Private Computation was made of what Horſe and Foot would be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to inveſt the place, and ſecure the neighbouring Iſles. And eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing was diſpoſed to the beſt advantage for the carrying on of the ſiege.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> comes to the King at <hi>Paris,</hi> to complain of his Majeſties actions towards the Biſhop of <hi>Verdun</hi> his Kinſman. He was anſwered, that Biſhops being his Majeſtie's Subjects owe reſpect and obedience to him. That when they fall off from their duties, it is the more juſt to puniſh their faults. That enjoying their Temporal States only
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:95405:188"/> in order to the Oath of Allegiance, which they all ſwear to his Majeſty, they do moſt eſpecially deſerve to be deprived of them when they break their ſaid Oath. That his Majeſty was more eſpecially concern'd to maintain his right in <hi>Verdun,</hi> which was a Frontier Town, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe becauſe the Biſhop had attempted againſt his Royal Authority in hindering the building of the Citadel, though it were a thing only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Soveraignty, and in which he was not at all concerned.</p>
               <p>But this was not the chief end of his journey. He pretended to do homage in his own name to the King for the Dutchy of <hi>Bar,</hi> as apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to him in Fee, and not in right of his Wife. But he therein met with greater obſtacles, than in that of the Biſhop of <hi>Verdun.</hi> The Duke obtained his requeſt for the Biſhop, upon condition he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Cenſures againſt the King's Officers, and for the future ſhould comport himſelf with more moderation. The Duke willingly became bound for his performance, and the King diſcharged the ſeizures, and ſetled all things in their former ſtate.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> and others endeavour now to divert the <hi>French</hi> King from his reſolution againſt <hi>Rochel.</hi> On <hi>July</hi> 28. 1627. the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet arriveth before <hi>Reé.</hi> They Landed ten thouſand men. The <hi>Sieur de Thoyras,</hi> was then Governour of the Citadel St. <hi>Martin</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Reé; Roſtaincler;</hi> the Baron of <hi>Chautail, Navailles,</hi> and divers other Gentlemen and light Horſe, and about one hundred and fifty <hi>French</hi> Souldiers reſiſting the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> were ſlain in the encounter, moſt part of the Officers being wounded. Fifteen Officers of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army were ſaid alſo to be killed, beſides divers Lieutenants and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. They likewiſe loſt one of their Colours, and had five or ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred killed and wounded.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> ſtormeth the Citadel of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> but could not take it. The Cardinal ſent to <hi>Bayonne</hi> for fifteen flat Veſſels called Primaces, built both to ſail and row withal, and very fleet and able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a ſtorm. In the end of <hi>Auguſt</hi> Captain <hi>Baſlin</hi> who Commanded theſe Primaces, came with them to the Sands of <hi>Olonne,</hi> where the Abbot of <hi>Marſillac</hi> received him joyfully: and his Veſſels being well ſtored with Victuals and Ammunition, he lent him Sixſcore men of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>de Champany,</hi> with ſome Voluntiers. On <hi>September</hi> 5. he ſet ſail in the head of his little Fleet about ſix a clock at night. Soon after he knew that he was near the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, he ſpread abroad his great Sails, and was eaſily diſcovered. But the Primaces going very ſwift could not be ſtopped by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſels. They went with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loſs; only ſome Sails and one or two Maſts were ſhattered, and one ſhot through with a Bullet. <hi>Baſlin</hi> having thus paſſed the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> fell upon the Barricado which they had made to hinder Relief: which conſiſted of great maſts linked together with Iron Chains, and tied with Cables faſtned to great Anchors. But many of the Primaces by reaſon
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:95405:189"/> of their lightneſs and ſwifneſs paſſed over: the reſt lighted on a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain place, where the foregoing night a Tempeſt had broken part of their <hi>Barricado,</hi> through which they paſſed without difficulty, ſo that about two in the night they ran a ſhore near one of the Baſtilions of the Citadel, a place where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> could not hurt them. The Relief was great both for their reputation and aſſiſtance. Ten other Pinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were got from <hi>Bayonne,</hi> which the Count <hi>de Grant-mont</hi> rigged out, and ſent under the Command of Captain <hi>Audum. October</hi> 4. they came on the Sands of <hi>Olonne.</hi> They were ſoon laden, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with twenty five other little Veſſels. Three hundred Souldiers went aboard them, and ſixty choice Gentlemen. Upon <hi>October</hi> 6. they put off. Two daies paſt (the wind changing) before they came to <hi>Reé,</hi> and that by day too. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet engaged them in a rough Fight. But their courage ſurmounting their danger, twenty nine of the Veſſels got clear to the Citadel, where they ran aſhore: on <hi>Friday</hi> morning <hi>October</hi> 8. five of their Veſſels were forced to give back. One only, in which were the <hi>Sieurs de Beaulieu</hi> and <hi>Razilly,</hi> was taken by the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Who were ſo incenſed at it, that they made in twenty four hours above two thouſand great ſhot upon the Port Saint <hi>Martin,</hi> ſo that there were only five Pinnaces and one Traverſin in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to ſail. But the Veſſels were unladed, and the Gentlemen and Souldiers ſafely landed in the Citadel.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> King having been ſick, after his recovery comes to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi> to drive the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of <hi>Reé.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to make his laſt attempt upon the Citadel of St. <hi>Martin.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> began an aſſault, but were repulſed. It is ſaid, that the beſieged took all the Ladders of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> fifty Priſoners, of which were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Captains and Officers, that they had killed four or five hundred, without loſing above eighteen or twenty men, and ſome few wounded, among which were the <hi>Sieurs de Sardaignes,</hi> and <hi>Gran Val,</hi> who being ſhot through the bodies died within a few daies after. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> doubting their Trenches would not ſecure them, forſook the one half of them, and ſhortly after reſolved to go back for <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Marſhal <hi>de Schomberg</hi> ſhortly after landeth there with fifty Barques about three in the morning, without being diſcovered by the Enemy. Theſe being conjoyned with other Souldiers fell upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and routed them. Their Horſe were loſt in the Mariſh. Their Cornet and twenty four Colours, and four Cannon were taken. About five hundred were killed on the place, beſides thoſe that were drowned in the Sea. Many Gentlemen of quality and Officers were killed. And (as the <hi>French</hi> Hiſtory ſaith) three thouſand Arms were taken in the Field, and above one thouſand five hundred Souldiers laden with the ſpoils.</p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:95405:189"/>
               <p>It is reported that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſcarce carried off one thouſand men, the reſt being either dead with ſickneſs, or killed: and moſt of them alſo died ſoon after their return into <hi>England,</hi> by reaſon of the diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities they there endured.</p>
               <p>After the King had obtained this ſignal Victory againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> he bent all his thoughts toward the beſieging of <hi>Rochel.</hi> The order of the whole Circumvallation was preſcribed by his Majeſty. He raiſed thirteen Forts, and ſeveral Redoubts upon the Trenches, the Circuit of which were three Leagues or thereabout, all out of Musket or Falcon ſhot, but not of Cannon. This Circumvallation being finiſhed cut off all relief by Land, and ſhortly after they were blocked up by Sea too.</p>
               <p>At this time the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> finds means to make an Aſſembly in the <hi>Ville d'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſez,</hi> where divers of their Deputies met together: and as he had no leſs Eloquence than Courage, he perſwaded them to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he had a mind to. They approved of thoſe ſuccours which he had negotiated in <hi>England</hi> as juſt and neceſſary; and they aſſured him not to enter into any Treaty of Peace with his Majeſty, without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and his own in particular. Whereupon they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted ſome of the chief of their Party to go to the Towns of <hi>Languedoc</hi> and <hi>Guienne:</hi> they alſo wrote to thoſe of <hi>Dauphiné</hi> and <hi>Vivarez,</hi> to encourage them to unite with them for the good of the Cauſe. They drew up the form of an Oath to be ſworn by the Conſuls, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of Towns, Lords, and Gentlemen, who would engage with them. An union very ſtrange, which divided Members from the Head, and ſo ſeparated Subjects from their Prince.</p>
               <p>After the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> had uſed all his devices, and ſeen the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Land at <hi>Reé,</hi> he took up Arms and appeared in the Field. He ſummoned the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to ſend thoſe Forces which he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed: but he could not obtain them. All that he could draw from him was a promiſe of fifty thouſand crowns. Thoſe Towns which were delivered up to him, were <hi>Niſmes, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe, Alets, Anduſe, le Vignan,</hi> St. <hi>Hippolite,</hi> St. <hi>Jean de Grandamenque, Samens, la Salle,</hi> and other ſmaller places: and with thoſe Forces drawn together he took during this year <hi>Realmont, Renel, Naves, Mazares, Pamiers, Caſtres, Soyon,</hi> and other Towns upon the <hi>Rhofere,</hi> and in <hi>Vivarez;</hi> and more he had done if the Cardinal under the King's Authority had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him. It cannot be imagined with how much care and trouble he kept thoſe together who were engaged in his Party; how low he was fain to ſtoop to work upon the meaner ſort of people; how many impertinencies he was forced to bear, how many inconſiderate diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes he was neceſſitated to hear, and to how much conſtraint he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to ſubject himſelf. He hath ſince proteſted to divers of his friends, that there is no care like that of retaining a mutinous people
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:95405:190"/> in that order, which is neceſſary for him to make them follow, who would raiſe any advantage to himſelf by their revolt.</p>
               <p>Then the King by the advice of Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> ſent the <hi>Sieur Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Privy Counſellour to his Majeſty, toward thoſe <hi>Hugonot</hi> Towns which the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> had attempted to revolt, that he might confirm them in their obedience. This man was one of their own Religion, which gave the King reaſon to hope they would be directed by him. Having received his Commiſſion, he went directly to <hi>Montauban,</hi> the chief Town of their Party next unto <hi>Rochel,</hi> and by which moſt of the other Towns would be guided. Upon his firſt arrival be called the Inhabitants together, he gave them his Letter of Credence writ by his Majeſty to them, and began to confirm them in their obedience. He laid before them the duty of Subjects toward their Prince; the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and calamities which they had ſuffered whilſt they fell off from their obedience: he repreſented to them the diſaſters which would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably fall upon them if they ſhould revolt: he informed them of the ſmall reaſon they had to believe the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi>'s promiſes, or the aid of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, which (he ſaid) could not hinder the relieving of the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Reé.</hi> His words ſo wrought on them, that they ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed a Declaration which they delivered to him, in which they profeſſed to live and die in that Loyalty which they owed unto his Majeſty. And all the other Towns unengaged in the revolt did the like. And his Prudence was ſo ſucceſsful, that the Towns of <hi>Briateſte, Caſtres, Pamiers, Puylaurens, Mazares,</hi> St. <hi>Amand, Cabarede, Mazares, Maſdazil, Arlat,</hi> and many others, made the like declarations under their hands and Seals. But the misfortune was, that having left divers Factious Spirits of <hi>Monſieur de Rohan</hi>'s Party in <hi>Caſtres, Pamiers,</hi> and ſome other of thoſe Towns before named, they remained not firm to thoſe reſolutions he had inſinuated to them, by which means the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> ſoon after became Maſter of them,</p>
               <p>The King unable to ſtop the D. of <hi>Rohan</hi>'s proceedings by fair means, makes uſe of force. He commanded an Army to be raiſed, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Conduct of it to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> ſending him a Commiſſion of Lieutenant General of his Forces in <hi>Languedoc, Dauphiné, Guienne,</hi> and <hi>Lyonnois.</hi> He divided the Army into two parts, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had the better half, the other being committed to the Duke of <hi>Montmorencie</hi>'s care, then Governour of <hi>Languedoc. Soyon,</hi> a ſtrong place upon the <hi>Rhone,</hi> was aſſaulted, and in two daies forced to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render. The Prince alſo ſtormed another little Town near to Saint <hi>Aubin,</hi> and put all the Souldiers in it to the ſword. Then they marched againſt certain places which the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> had reſolved to defend, but the fear which the Inhabitants and Souldiers apprehended on ſight of the Army, made them open their Gates, ſo they entred without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:95405:190"/>
               <p>Then they became Maſters of <hi>Corconne</hi> and <hi>Aubenas. Montmoren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> purſued the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> and conſtrained him to flight: he maintained the fight about two hours, and ſaw about an hundred of his Souldiers killed, fifteen of his Guard, ſeven or eight Captains ſlain, and divers others wounded. In fine he ſaw at the years end, that he had ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little advanced his deſign.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rochellers</hi> now ſend to the King of <hi>England</hi> to demand ſuccour. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1628"/> Order was given for the Rigging out a Fleet in behalf of the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> and the Command to be given to the Earl of <hi>Denbigh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King goes from <hi>Rochel</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> to diſſipate thoſe Factions, which began to riſe thereabouts, by the <hi>Hugonots</hi> in <hi>Picardy, Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagnie,</hi> and <hi>Brie. Richlieu</hi> Commandeth the Army in his Majeſtie's ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet being now ready to hoiſe ſail for <hi>Rochel,</hi> the King reſolveth to return thither. The <hi>Rochellers</hi> are ſummoned by an Herauld to ſurrender to the King: but their minds and anſwers were full of inſolency, ſo that the King bent all his thoughts to prepare for the fighting with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet at their firſt coming. About the eleventh of <hi>May</hi> they were deſcried two Leagues off the point of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reille.</hi> An order was reſolved on by the King, aſſiſted with his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals and Sea Captains, and ſo delivered to the Commander of <hi>Valencay,</hi> who diſtributed it among the Officers.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> attempt to relieve <hi>Rochel,</hi> but in vain; and when the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chellers</hi> were embarqued, after the exhortations of their Miniſters, and their Captains had ſolemnly ſworn to paſs the Bank in ſpite of all oppoſition, or die in the attempt, they were ſtruck with ſuch faint-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, that not a man durſt ſtir his hand: and <hi>Vincent</hi> their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter could no longer ſpeak unto them, as himſelf confeſſed in a Letter to a friend of His.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet now departeth, whereupon great diſſentions ariſe among the <hi>Rochellers.</hi> Then the King ſent another ſummons to them to yield. <hi>Breton,</hi> Herauld at Arms, was commanded to do it in form, with his Coat of Arms, who went into the City, required them to lay down their Arms, aſſured them of Pardon for their paſt Crime, and threatning them with the contrary in caſe they ſhould now refuſe it. But they being animated by their Preachers, the Town continued obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in their inſolencies.</p>
               <p>After a feigned Treaty between the King and the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> the Town was reduced by Famine to extream miſeries.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal perſwaded his Majeſty to ſettle divers Catholick Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Provinces, and wrought upon the Duke of <hi>Tremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> to forſake the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rochellers</hi> when they ſaw there was no hopes of ſuccour from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and that they died by thouſands of the Famine, made divers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:95405:191"/> of accommodation. Since the laſt ſix months there had died about ten thouſand of the Famine.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal declared to them, they muſt not think of any other condition, than abſolutely to ſubmit to his Maſter's will. At laſt they choſe twelve of the principal among them, moſt of which could hardly creep, to beg his Majeſtie's pardon, to aſſure him that they would live and die in the obedience which they owed to him, without demanding any other conditions, than what his Majeſty ſhould pleaſe to give them. The King granted them the pardon which they deſired, and the <hi>Sieur</hi> of <hi>Herbaut</hi> Secretary of State, read the Patent to them, by which his Majeſty pardoned their Rebellion, diſcharged them of all Acts of Hoſtility, ordained that they ſhould be reſtored to their goods, granted them the Exerciſe of their Religion in the City, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that all the Souldiers in the City ſhould enjoy the ſame Grace: and that the chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The King before he left <hi>Rochel,</hi> publiſhed a Declaration, wherein was contained, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion ſhould be freely Exerciſed there, both in the City and Government of <hi>Aulnis.</hi> That the Churches which had been lately deſtroyed thereabouts, ſhould be re-edified, and reſtored to them in whoſe Poſſeſſion they formerly were, together with all their appurtenances.

               <p>The King took this courſe to keep <hi>Rochel</hi> in obedience. He depoſed the Mayor, and diſcharged the Shrievalty and Commonalty of the Town without hopes of reſtauration.

He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Walls, the Ramparts, and the reſt of the Fortifications to be razed, and the Ditches to be filled up, leaving only the Towers <hi>de</hi> S. <hi>Nicholas, de la Chains, &amp; de la lantern</hi> ſtanding, with that part of the Wall toward the Sea, to preſerve the Town from Pirates. He appointed alſo, that no ſtranger ſhould have an Houſe or Family in the Town, without his Majeſtie's permiſſion had and obtained: or that any Hereticks (as the Proteſtants were called) ſhould return to their former dwellings.

               <p>He then commanded the Inhabitants to be diſarmed, and that certain Regiments ſhould remain in the Town until it were quite demoliſhed.

               <p>In the mean time he treated ſecretly with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> from whom he had alſo obtain'd a promiſe of ſome ſupply of money.

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> obſerving what a terrour the taking of theſe two places had infuſed into his whole Faction, and knowing on the other ſide that a Peace with <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>England</hi> was already conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, began to apprehend at laſt he ſhould be totally deſerted by all his Confederates and Friends, and left alone to bear the ſhock of all his Majeſties Victorious Arms; which made him in time ſeriouſly apply himſelf to his mercy, to avoid the ſevere effects of his juſtice.</p>
               <p>A Peace was concluded in <hi>July</hi> 1629. with the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> which all the other Cities of his Party likewiſe accepted, except <hi>Montauban,</hi> which for ſome daies ſtood out, but afterwards was ſurrendered to Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> who ſettled all things in peace, to the great happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the King and the whole Kingdom.</p>

               <p>Now new ſtirs are at Court occaſioned by the diſcontents of the Queen-Mother and the <hi>Monſieur.</hi> The Queen-Mother profeſſeth open hatred to the Cardinal: ſhe directly oppoſeth all his Counſels, which how well ſoever they ſucceeded, ſhe ſtill found matter enough to render them ſuſpected to the King, and to diſcredit them by ſiniſter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was grown by this time ſenſible of the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Peace he had concluded at <hi>Suze;</hi> to which the loſs of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat</hi> ſtuck mainly in his ſtomach. The Duke therefore ſeizeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the <hi>French</hi> in his Territories, not ſo much as excepting the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Religious Orders. The Marſhal of <hi>Crequi</hi> hereupon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceth to <hi>Pignerol</hi> with one thouſand Horſe, ſix thouſand Foot and ſome Cannon, and reduced the Town and Citadel to the obedience of the <hi>French</hi> King.

               </p>
               <p>The Cardinal offered all ſorts of ſubmiſſion to the Queen-Mother to reconcile himſelf to her favour, but all in vain, ſhe was ſtill ſo implacably bent againſt him, that the Peace of <hi>Italy</hi> being now concluded, and the time come wherein the King had promiſed her to remove the Cardinal, ſhe was importunately inſtant with the King for the accompliſhment of his Royal word. At laſt the order was ſigned for the Cardinal's removal.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal withdrawes himſelf a little time from the Court, but by the advice of the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> reſtores himſelf again with the

The Cardinal was of opinion that his Majeſty ſhould require them to meet at <hi>Charenton,</hi> becauſe being within his view, they would have the leſs freedom to renew ſuch Cabals as they had formerly made in their Aſſemblies of <hi>Guienne</hi> and <hi>Lauguedoc.</hi> This Order was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and the <hi>Sieur de Galland,</hi> Counſellour to his Majeſty, was ſent to be Preſident in the King's behalf; his Loyalty was not to be ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; and they were obliged to accept of him in regard of divers au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentique teſtimonies which made appear, that this Order was confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to that of Councils aſſembled in the Primitive times, which they profeſſed to honour. The King eſpecially commanded him to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that no Propoſition were made which did not concern their Faith or Diſcipline: to ſilence them in his Majeſtie's name, in caſe they ſhould diſcourſe of any other affairs, and to eſtabliſh ſuch Rules as the Cardinal had propoſed to keep that Party in ſubmiſſion: To this end he uſed his utmoſt Prudence and Loyalty, he perſwaded them to enact, that there ſhould not any more National Aſſemblies be made, but in the preſence of a Commiſſary from the King, who might (by teſtifying their obedience) be a means of continuing them in quiet.

                  </note> after his return the Cardinal undertook to compoſe a difference between the Biſhops and Friers, which had made a great noiſe for ſundry ages together. The Friers relying upon their priviledges obtained from <hi>Rome,</hi> pretended to have power both to Preach and confeſs, without permiſſion from the Biſhops. And the Biſhops unto whom all people within their Dioceſs are ſubject by common right, did perpetually thwart that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion. They could not down with the Friers Priviledges, alledging they ought to be declared void, as being repugnant to the Primitive Conſtitutions of the Church. This quarrel had been eſpecially fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted during the laſt year, by reaſon ſome Books had been publiſhed in the name of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Catholicks, which preferred the Monaſtical life before that of the Prelates, and ſeemed to imply that Friers were more neceſſary, at leaſt more uſeful, to the Church than the ordinary Paſtors. Was it probable that the whole Society of Friers would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh the Priviledges they had obtained from the See of <hi>Rome?</hi> On the other ſide, what reaſon was there, that the Prelates ſhould have ſo little Authority over them in Adminiſtration of Sacraments, and the Word of God; ſeeing of old Friers were only mixed among the Laity, and addreſſed themſelves unto the Biſhops Congregations, to receive the Sacraments from their hands, or thoſe who executed their charge? The Cardinal took upon himſelf to end this difference, though he was at that time employ'd in the moſt important affairs of Chriſtendom.</p>
               <p>He therefore cauſed the Superiours of the Orders to come before him one by one, well knowing, that to negotiate ſuch a buſineſs in a publick Aſſembly would be a labour in vain. He was a perſon well verſed in all Antiquities, and accordingly he repreſented to them, how that in the firſt inſtitution of Monks they were Conſecrated unto God by the mediation of Biſhops, who received their Vows, inſtructed them, and directed their Conſciences. He laid before them the Original of the whole affair, and ſhewed them, how that the Son of God had ſubjected all thoſe who ſold their goods and followed him, unto the Apoſtles, whoſe Succeſſours the Biſhops are, whereupon they making a ſtrict profeſſion of leading an Evangelical life, were more particularly obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to obſerve the Order eſtabliſhed in and by the Goſpel: not that he would queſtion the validity of thoſe exemptions granted from the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> unto which he owed much more reſpect and obedience, than to debate the Ordinances thereof; yet that he muſt needs inform them, that they could not be diſpenſed with from following the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:95405:194"/> eſtabliſhed by Jeſus Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, in Adminiſtring the Sacraments and Word of God. That in fine, themſelves could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but they were obliged to relinquiſh ſome part of their pretenſions for the avoiding of trouble to the Church, which was likely to enſue upon this account, and whereof the <hi>Hugonots</hi> diſcourſed with much freedom. That this peace would be more acceptable to God, than all the advantages it could otherwiſe procure unto particular perſons. That it would tend unto their honours, by teſtifying unto the world the moderation of their minds, and humility of their ſpirits, and that the world would eſteem the better of them. That he ſhould not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly propoſe, that the Biſhops ſhould have ordinary juriſdiction over their perſons, or power to viſit their Monaſteries; but that leaving them full liberty to execute their Monaſtical Functions, it ſeemed fit unto him, that they ſhould not refuſe to be dependent upon them in matter of Adminiſting the Sacraments, of Thankſgiving and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance (as he called them) of Preaching the Word; and to admit them to have power to repeal this Priviledge which was derived from them, according as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> had preſcribed.</p>
               <p>Accordingly each one addreſſed himſelf to obſerve the Cardinals di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections: and although ſome unreaſonable perſons began at firſt to create ſome difficulties, yet his prudence ſoon prevailed over them, inſomuch that they could not be thought the ſame men, who had ſo lately and ſo ſtiffly maintained their Independence on their Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. He cauſed a Declaration to be drawn, wherein they acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves uncapable to Preach without Examination, Licence, and approbation from their Biſhops firſt had and obtained, and that the ſaid Biſhops might at any time revoke the ſaid Licences: withal, that they neither could nor ought to hear the Confeſſions of Secular men without approbation; which the ſaid Biſhops might likewiſe repeal, in caſe of any incapacity, or publick ſcandal. Every one ſubſcribed thereunto.</p>
               <p>The Biſhops diſpatched Copies thereof into all parts: and thus the Cardinal ended a difference which had made ſuch a noiſe ſo many Ages together.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> having raiſed ſome ſtirs, was encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by the <hi>Mareſhal de Scomberg,</hi> defeated and taken Priſoner. The Parliament of <hi>Tholouſe</hi> by the King's appointment having made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs againſt him with all legal proceeding, condemned him to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed. The Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> beſought the King to allow him a Confeſſour. And the King gave order to the Marſhal <hi>de Breze,</hi> to conduct Father <hi>Arnoux</hi> ſuperiour of the Jeſuites, to aſſiſt him. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made his Confeſſion, and communicated, he made his will; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed unto <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Cardinal one of the rareſt Pictures of <hi>France,</hi> repreſenting Saint <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> dying. He was executed in the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:95405:194"/> Court of the Town-houſe, where the King commanded it to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> had acquired ſo great credit in <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc,</hi> that he not only drew off divers men of quality from his Majeſtie's ſervice, but ſeveral Biſhops alſo, and perſwaded ſeven or eight to ſubſcribe unto the Declaration of the States. Some recanted what they had done; and became conformable to what the King had ordained in his Declaration; but others ſtood out in their Rebellion, among whom were thoſe of <hi>Alby</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſez,</hi> who had delivered their Cities into <hi>Monſieur</hi>'s hands, of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> who would have done the like, of <hi>Alets,</hi> and S. <hi>Pont,</hi> well-willers to the Rebellion, either by raiſing of Forces, or Proviſions to be ſent to places already revolted.</p>
               <p>The Archbiſhop of <hi>Narbon,</hi> Preſident of the States, had not been defective in endeavouring to divert them from their deſigns, repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to them how contrary it was to their Profeſſion, which ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to procure Peace, and to ſhew examples of obedience unto others.</p>
               <p>The King finding them who ſhould have preſerved the people in obedience both by exhortation and example, to excite them to Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, could not put up ſuch diſorders, but appointed Collectors in their ſeveral Biſhopricks to receive their Revenues, and to employ them in reparation of Religious houſes and Epiſcopal Sees: and thinking it improper to intruſt the care of Souls with ſuch diſloyal perſons, he procured a Breviate from the Pope, addreſſed to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Arles,</hi> the Biſhops of St. <hi>Flour,</hi> and St. <hi>Malo,</hi> to draw up their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs againſt them. The Biſhops of <hi>Alby</hi> and <hi>Niſmes</hi> were depoſed, death preventing the Biſhop of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſez</hi> from receiving the like puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The reſt were reſtored to their Biſhopricks, there being not evidences ſufficient to condemn them.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> had been advertiſed, that it was principally the Archbiſhop of <hi>Burdeaux</hi> who had exaſperated Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> againſt him, and who had rendred his viſit at <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> (when he went to ſee him attended by his Guards) ſuſpected to him.<note place="margin">The Hiſt. of the Duke <hi>d'Eſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</hi> Lib. 10.</note> A thing, that had offended him to the laſt degree, and he had publickly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of that proceeding (for his paſſions were never concealed) which was alſo reported to the Archbiſhop, who was at this time obliged to come into his Dioceſs to make ſome reſidence there. He departed therefore from Court, and took the way of <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Archbiſhop being on his way toward <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> turned a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle out of the ordinary Road to go into a Territory belonging to his Biſhoprick, called <hi>Monravel,</hi> where being arrived, he was informed, that one of the Dukes Guards had been aſſiſting in the Execution of ſome Acts of juſtice, wherein he was himſelf immediately concern'd,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:95405:195"/> and which would otherwiſe perhaps have met with ſome oppoſition. He therefore ſent a Gentleman to the Duke, to return his thanks for ſo opportune a kindneſs. What ever the deſign of this Complement might be, it was very ill received. The Duke made anſwer to the Gentleman who came from the Archbiſhop, that thanks were neither ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary nor due to a perſon, who had no deſign to oblige: That if any thing by his orders had been done to his Maſter's advantage, it had been done upon no other account than the meer conſideration of juſtice, without any reſpect to his friendſhip; and ſo diſmiſſed him.</p>
               <p>The Archbiſhop ſent to Court to acquaint the Cardinal what had paſſed between the Duke and him, and to receive inſtructions from him, how he was to behave himſelf, if matters ſhould grow to a greater height between them. To which the Cardinal's anſwer was, that he aſſured him of a powerful Protection: whereupon the Archbiſhop enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the Aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ir to ſuch an height, as even to be himſelf the Aggreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, at the firſt daſh giving him very ſenſible and publick affronts.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> had in Propriety, as Lord of the Mannour of <hi>Puipaulin,</hi> the Royalty of the <hi>Clie</hi> of <hi>Burdeaux</hi> (which is the Fiſh Market there) ſo as that he might l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>wfully forbid any to enter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into whom he had no mind to admit. He therefore commanded the Archbiſhop's Officers one fifth day to be excluded, that they might be conſtrained to take their Fiſh without the Bar, with the reſt of the people. Theſe men refuſed to receive it after that manner, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they could not have it. The Duke alſo knowing it would be brought in from other places, cauſed his Guards moreover to watch all the avenues to hinder it, by whom ſome were turned back that would have done the Archbiſhop that ſervice; and in the end ſome of his own Domeſticks were very roughly handled.</p>
               <p>The Archbiſhop by publick declarations complain'd of the violence had been offered to him by a ſort of men purpoſely ſet on to do it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing them by the name of the <hi>Ruſſet Caſſocks,</hi> which was the Duke's Livery, demanding of the Magiſtrate protection, and aid to oppoſe them, and proteſting to retire with his Clergy if they would not provide for his ſafety.</p>
               <p>Then the Duke commanded the Lieutenant of his Guards, the next day after the Archbiſhop had exhibited this injurious Bill againſt his Guards, to go with all his Souldiers to preſent himſelf before him, and to ask of him, if among all thoſe he knew any one man who was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to commit an unhandſom action? The Lieutenant did as he was commanded, and waited near to the Archbiſhops Palace, his return from the City; who ſeeing him come in his Coach, preſented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſpeak unto him. The Archbiſhop ſeeing ſo many Souldiers attending the Lieutenant, commanded his Coach-man to drive on:</p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:95405:195"/>
               <p>The Lieutenant with his hat in his hand was urgent with the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop to hear him, aſſuring him he had nothing to ſay that could any way offend him. But all was in vain, the Coach-man was ſtill called unto to drive on. The Lieutenant called in the end to one of his Companions to lay hold on the reins, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o ſtop the Horſes: which being accordingly done, the Archbiſhop immediately went out of his Coach, crying out there was violence offered to his Perſon, and ſo retired himſelf into his Houſe.</p>
               <p>The Archbiſhop in the afternoon of the ſame day, being <hi>October</hi> 29. ſummoned in all the Orders and Societies of Eccleſiaſticks in the City, he there expoſed before them the open violence he pretended had been offered him. Moſt of the Clergy fir'd by his Rhetorick, concluded upon an Excommunication: and upon <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1. he thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred out his Excommunication againſt the Lieutenant of the Guards, and all his Companions, and tacitly againſt the Duke himſelf. Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> endeavours an Accommodation betwixt them, but in vain.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> calls an Aſſembly of ſeveral Learned Divines in his own houſe, and all the Profeſſours of the Canon Law, to have their advice upon this Cenſure. The moſt part of them were of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That there was ſome Exception to be taken againſt the Cenſure, and ſaid, that all the forms being not obſerved, they thought that thoſe againſt whom it was pronounced, were not obliged by it. The Duke preſently publiſhed their opinion by ſound of Trumpet; at which the Archbiſhop was ſo incenſed, that he cited theſe men to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
               <p>The Doctors ſurprized at this Citation, flie to the Duke's Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, who iſſued out an Ordinance, wherein he prohibiteth all ſorts of perſons, of what quality or profeſſion ſoever, to meet in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Aſſembly, either in the Archbiſhop's Palace, or elſe-where, without his ſpecial Licence, excepting nevertheleſs the Religious and Eccleſiaſticks immediately belonging to the Congregation of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, and whoſe Counſels he cuſtomarily made uſe of, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ordering the Diſcipline of his Dioceſs.</p>
               <p>The Archbiſhop iſſued out a ſentence againſt all thoſe who had been of that opinion which the Duke had publiſhed, whereby they were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted their Charges and Eccleſiaſtical Functions, prohibited to Preach the Word of God, to hear Confeſſions, to Adminiſter Sacraments in the Dioceſs of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> Commanding the ſuperiour Provincials to chaſtiſe them, and expell them out of the Covents of <hi>Burdeaux.</hi> By the See of <hi>Rome</hi> all Prelates are inhibited to make any Cenſures againſt Religious Orders, upon penalty of drawing that Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation on their own heads, which they intended to inflict upon others.</p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:95405:196"/>
               <p>The Religious hereupon appealed from this ſentence to the Pope. But the Archbiſhop aſſembled the Superiours of the Religious houſes in his Palace to condemn that opinion which they had given in favour of <hi>Naugas</hi> the Lieutenant.</p>
               <p>The Duke hereup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n placed the Archers of the Watch of the City up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the Avenues and Gates of the Archbiſhop's Palace, to hinder ſuch as would obey the Archbiſhop's ſummons. The Archbiſhop ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving notice hereof, immediately puts on his Pontifical Robes, and cauſing himſelf to be followed by ſome Eccleſiaſticks, together with what people he had about him, went on foot out of the Houſe, crying out in the Streets as he paſſed along, <hi>To me my People, There is no more liberty for the Church.</hi> In this poſture he went to ſeveral Religious Houſes of the City, gathering after him a great number of people (who ran from all parts to the novelty) as he went along, and in the end returned back towards his own Palace, without being able to raiſe any commotion in the City.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe things were in doing, the Duke was at the <hi>Capuccines,</hi> in one of the remoteſt parts of the City, and having news brought him by two Preſidents of the Parliament what had paſſed, the Duke ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mounted his Coach, following that way the Archbiſhop was gone, having in company with him the <hi>Count de Maillè,</hi> and the <hi>Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor de la juſtice.</hi> The Duke's Coach-man drave on through all till he came near the Archbiſhop's Palace, where he overtook him.</p>
               <p>The Archbiſhop ſtill continued on his pace; the Duke demanded of him by what Authority he ſtirred up this Commotion in his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? he was by the Archbiſhop interrupted, who cried aloud, <hi>Strike Tyrant, thy blowes will be to me Flowers and Roſes, Thou art Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated.</hi> In this buſtle the Duke catching him by the hand, lifted it up twice or thrice, and ſet it againſt his Breaſt. But the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop with his hat on ſtill provoking him with injurious language, the Duke with a Cane he had in his hand touched the brim of his hat and thruſt it off his head to the ground, telling him at the ſame time, he did not know the reſpect he ought him. But if the Reverence to his profeſſion did not reſtrain him, he would make him know it. Then the Duke being return'd to his own houſe, the Archbiſhop forthwith repaired to his Church, and pronounced the ſentence of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation againſt him, and all that were with him.</p>
               <p>The Archbiſhop ſends away a diſpatch thereof to the Court, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he gives the Cardinal an account of the violence that had been offered to him, at which the Cardinal was highly incenſed. The Court ſides with the Archbiſhop, and the Parliament of <hi>Burdeaux</hi> alſo, who draw up an information againſt the Duke.</p>
               <p>The Duke likewiſe ſent to the King informations of what had paſſed, whereupon the King ſent Order to the Archbiſhop, to take away the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:95405:196"/> interdiction; and to the Duke to depart out of his Government, and retire to his houſe of <hi>Plaſſac,</hi> which is out of the Dioceſs of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi> to expect the Pope's reſolution, to whom the deciſion of that Controverſie belonged, ſeeing they had appealed to him, which hung in ſuſpence about five or ſix months.</p>
               <p>After the Dukes retirement to <hi>Plaſſac,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1634"/> the Archbiſhop of <hi>Burdeaux</hi> goes to <hi>Paris,</hi> who being arrived in Court, all the Prelates who were then in <hi>Paris,</hi> aſſembled after an uſual manner, to deliberate among themſelves what was beſt to be done in the Archbiſhops behalf: Which convocation the Duke having notice of, he ſent to them his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute ſubmiſſion to the Church.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>de la Valette,</hi> who was returned back to Court, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Audience in the Aſſembly in the name of the Duke his Father. Which being granted, he there laid down ſuch reaſons before them, that of five and twenty Prelates which were there preſent, thirteen were of opinion to take upon them the quality of Judges under the good pleaſure of the Pope and the King, the Duke having abſolutely ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf to their determination. But this reſolution was not for the guſt of the Court.</p>
               <p>They aſſembled then again at the Palace of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux,</hi> and from thence ſent a Deputation to the King, wherein the Archbiſhop of <hi>Arles</hi> was to ſpeak for the reſt. The Biſhop in his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion uſed all the odious terms he could invent, to poſſeſs the King with the higheſt ſenſe of the Duke's miſdemeanour. Upon which occaſion <hi>Caſpian</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nantes,</hi> one of the moſt vertuous Prelates of his time, cried out, <hi>That if it were poſſible for the Devil to ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God Almighty, to ſuch a degree as the Duke did, he would infallibly obtain pardon for all his offences: and that notwithſtanding the Church deny'd this pardon to a Chriſtian, who had ever ſerved God and his Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the Complaints of the Clergy prefer'd to the King by the mouth of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Arles,</hi> the Cardinal who was preſent at the Council, was of opinion, That upon the Duke's ſingle confeſſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in his anſwer, he ought to be reputed Excommunicat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: and as ſo, that the King ought to declare him lapſed from all his Offices and Dignities, till by vertue of his Abſolution he ſhould be re-united to the Church.</p>
               <p>The Duke now ſends his Secretary from <hi>Plaſſac</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his Abſolution. But ſo many rubs from <hi>France</hi> were laid in his way, that four whole months were laps'd before the Duke could receive his Abſolution.</p>
               <p>The Duke's Abſolution being reſolved on, and order given to the Archbiſhop to give it him, and the day for Abſolution being appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> attended by the Duke <hi>de la Valette,</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:95405:197"/> and ſeveral perſons of quality, went to <hi>Coutras,</hi> whither being come, the Archbiſhop who was already there, accompanied with his Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticks, went firſt to the Church, where the Duke following after, and preſenting himſelf before him, kneeled down upon a Velvet Cuſhion laid ready for that purpoſe. In this poſture, and in the preſence of five Counſellours of the Parliament of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> who were by the King's order to be aſſiſting at this Ceremony, the Archbiſhop pronounced his Abſolution in theſe words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Et Ego Authoritate Eccleſiae, &amp; eâ quâ fungor, abſolvo te à vincu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo Excommunicationis, quam incurriſti, quia immunitatem Eccleſiae meae Metropolitanae perfregiſti, manum armatam militum, ut me cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumque meum in via ſiſterent, miſiſti: Statione diſpoſitâ Palatium no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum vallaſti; Juriſdictionem Eccleſiaſticam violaſti; eamque tibi ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogaſti: Nos, Clerumque noſtrum inſignibus, &amp; indignis contumeliis affeciſti: In nomine Patris, &amp; Filii,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Though the Duke was no great Latiniſt, he had nevertheleſs ſo much, as to underſtand many words of this Abſolution, by which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved they were not according to the ordinary ſtile of the Church. The Duke after his return received by an expreſs Currier from Court, his Majeſties orders to return into <hi>Guienne</hi> to his former Government. And it happened well not to the Duke alone, but as much alſo to the Province, and to the whole Kingdom, that the Duke was at this time reſtored to his Command.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1635"/> Soon after a great Sedition was raiſed in <hi>Burdeaux</hi> by reaſon of the Exciſe upon Victuallers. The Duke oppoſeth the Seditious, forceth divers Barricado's, wherein divers of his men are ſlain and wounded, and beateth down their Barricado's, and reduceth the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to its obedience to the King. The whole Province of <hi>Guien</hi> except <hi>Montauban,</hi> brake out into open Arms, committing every-where all the barbarous Acts of an inhumane fury. The Duke ſends his orders into all parts of the Province, which a little quiets them.</p>
               <p>The commotions of the City were no ſooner appeaſed, but that madneſs diffuſed it ſelf into the Villages of the adjacent Country. The Boors in great numbers got into the Suburb of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> called S. <hi>Surin,</hi> to which place the Duke's houſe was near enough for him to hear their Clamours, and from his Chamber-window that looked into the fields to ſee the fires they had kindled in ſeveral houſes, of which the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part were miſerably conſumed. The Duke being under great indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition got out of his bed, mounted to horſe by night, and with forty or fi ty Gentlemen, his Guards, and ſome of the Town-Companies, went out toward theſe Mutineers. They had fortified themſelves in ſeveral places of the Suburb, had Barricado'd the Church, and made a ſhew of defending themſelves. But at the Duke's arrival they almoſt all
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:95405:197"/> disbanded and ran away, none ſave thoſe in the Church making any reſiſtance, who alſo at the firſt Volley diſcharged upon them fled after their fellows; forty or fifty of them were ſlain by the Cavalry purſuing them, at whoſe death the Duke was greatly afflicted. The report of this execution diſperſing it ſelf in a moment throughout the whole Province, cauſed a calm every-where.</p>
               <p>Now the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> Son to the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> was ſent at the head of a great Army into <hi>Germany,</hi> the Command where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was equally divided between him and Duke <hi>Weimar:</hi> The Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> was diſſatisfied that the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> advanced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church by his Learning, Birth, and Fortune, to ſo eminent a degree of dignity and reputation, that ſhould wholly have applied himſelf to her ſervice, that he ſhould hazard his life in ſo dangerous a profeſsion. He ever apprehended it would be fatal to him, and therefore had done all he could to diſſwade him from it, employing alſo the endeavours of ſeveral his moſt intimate friends and ſervants, but all in vain. Either the humour of the time, the inclination of his Son, the neceſſity of his deſtiny, or all together ſtill prevailing with him above the fears or foreſight of ſo affectionate a Father.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> was faln from <hi>Lorrain</hi> into <hi>Alſatia,</hi> where he took <hi>Ruffach</hi> by ſtorm. Then Commiſſary <hi>Bullion</hi> had private directions to go along with <hi>Monſieur de Lande</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour and Governour of the <hi>French</hi> Forces which were in <hi>Rhetia,</hi> to the enterprize of the <hi>Valtoline.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> Forces marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Mountain <hi>Spluga,</hi> and came to <hi>Chiavena,</hi> advanced to <hi>Riva,</hi> and paſſing over <hi>Saſſocorbe,</hi> (which is a Rock between the Mountain and the Lake, by which way they are to paſs who will go from thence by Land into the Valley, which is a very ſtrait paſſage) they came to <hi>Traon,</hi> not meeting with any hindrance. For the State of <hi>Milan</hi> wanting neceſſary Forces for maintaining it ſelf, was rather thinking upon ſelf defence, than how to ſet upon another. And becauſe the <hi>French</hi> mens deſign was to ſhut up all paſſages into that State, in ſuch ſort as it ſhould be impoſſible for the Emperour to ſend them any ſuccour by the way of <hi>Tyrol,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> came thither on <hi>April</hi> 24. with two Regiments of <hi>Switzers,</hi> and five Companies of Horſe, and made himſelf Maſter of the reſt of the Valley. But after <hi>Rohan</hi> had held it divers months, the <hi>Griſon</hi> Colonels and Captains laying claim to much money; and others who were deſtined to have the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, claiming the reſtitution of the <hi>Valtoline</hi> according to promiſe, they mutiny'd, and betaking themſelves to Arms throughout all <hi>Rhetia,</hi> they ſecured the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> in the Fort of <hi>Maynfelt,</hi> and enforced the <hi>French</hi> to forſake them, and to return to their own King's domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:95405:198"/>
               <p>Then the <hi>Griſons</hi> entred into this Valley, and recovered their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Rohan</hi> not being able to eſcape from <hi>Coira,</hi> whither he was brought from <hi>Maynfelt</hi> as an Hoſtage, remained there until ſuch time as his men were gone out of <hi>Rhetia.</hi>

                     <hi>Howel</hi>'s Hiſt. of <hi>Lewes</hi> XIII.</note>It is very properly, and with great reaſon, that the Apoſtle ranks Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies among Crimes and carnal ſins, becauſe we often perceive that by a ſecret judgement of God, thoſe uſe to fall and tumble into them, who ſwelling with the vanity and confidence of their own ſenſe, or walking according to the fleſh, ſuffer not themſelves to be led by the ſpirit of God, nor believe that they are tyed to any rule, but they taſte nothing but what pleaſeth man as he is a ſenſitive Animal. Whereof <hi>Francis Cupif</hi> of <hi>Angers,</hi> whom the ſacred Faculty had nouriſhed before in her boſom, and at laſt unhappily received into the number of her Doctors, to the great ſcandal of all good men, and the applauſe of the enemies of the Croſs of Chriſt, hath lately given an horrid and moſt deplorable example. For according to the honour that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon him in our School, not minding the law he had received from ſo good a Mother, which might have drawn down upon his head all graces from God and men; and having quite forgot the Oath he had made ſo oft, and whereunto according to ancient inſtitution all new Graduates, and all ſuch who are promoted to the degree of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorſhips are ſolemnly obliged; He is miſerably fallen (ſaid they) from the holy Catholick Church, whereby he hath drawn upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the loſs of his ſoul before God, ſhame and infamy before men, and malediction from all parts; This imprudent Son is become the grief and ſadneſs of his Mother, then, when by a perfidious prevarication abjuring the true Doctrine, he hath moſt impudently turn'd Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, giving up his name to impiety and falſhood. But whence can it proceed, that he ſhould ſo eaſily fall into ſo fearful a precipice, but from the natural preſumption of his own judgement, and from the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:95405:198"/> of unbridled pleaſure, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Whence it comes to paſs, that being blinded, and walking continually according to his own co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, having ſhaken off the ſweet and light Yoak of Jeſus Chriſt, he is become a voluntary ſlave to Hereſie, which is the height of all ſins. It being therefore true, that as the Chriſtian Emperours ſaid, Whatſoever is attempted againſt Divine Religion, becomes injurious to all: with greater reaſon the Sacred Faculty of Theology hath believ'd, That the wrong which is done Jeſus Chriſt, and to the Catholick Faith by this degenerate Child, did concern her ſo far as to pronounce a grave Cenſure according to the atrocity of the Crime, againſt ſuch a notorious infamy, and to ſeparate him totally from Her, and her Nurſery, though it be nothing at all to be fear'd that ſuch Baſtard Plants will take any deep roots. Curſed be thou degenerate Child, which goeſt on after thine own Counſel, not according to mine, which warpeſt a web, but not by my direction, which doſt add ſin to ſin, which goeſt down to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to the Synagogue of Satan, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulteſt not with me, nor remembreſt my Precepts. Thou haſt reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted my Diſcipline, hoping for ſuccour in the help of <hi>Calvin</hi> and his followers, and haſt confidence in the ſhadow of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that is to ſay, in the Conventicle of Hereticks: but this imaginary ſtrength ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thy confuſion; and the confidence of this ſhadow which thou followeſt, in deſpiſing the Body of the Orthodoxal Church, ſhall turn to thy ſhame. So Anathema was pronounced, and publickly fix'd up againſt him.</p>
               <p>The Queen of <hi>France</hi> was brought to bed of a Prince on <hi>September</hi> 5. 1638. at St. <hi>German de lay,</hi> he was born in the twenty third year after the Marriage of the King and Queen.

               <p>All <hi>France</hi> was full of jollity, as they expreſſed by their voices, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, and actions.

               </p>
               <p>In the year 1640. a great combuſtion happened in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> which grew ſo furious, that the Viceroy with his Wife and ſome of his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were murthered, and his houſe burned to the ground. This tumult by degrees turned to an abſolute revolt from their Sovereign natural King, inſomuch that they fled to <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> quickly hearken unto them; ſo there was a Treaty at <hi>Narbon,</hi> whither they ſent twelve per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of quality for Hoſtages; and an Order iſſued out, That He ſhould be branded with an hot Iron, who ſpake of any accommodation with
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:95405:199"/> 
                  <hi>Caſtile.</hi> It was agreed on, that upon putting themſelves under the Royal Protection of the moſt Chriſtian King, he ſhould furniſh them with an Army of ſix thouſand Foot, and two thouſand Horſe, to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the <hi>Catalans.</hi> Hereupon three Commiſſioners were ſent to <hi>Paris,</hi> one for the Clergy; another for the Nobility, and a third for the Gentry and Commonalty.</p>
               <p>The chiefeſt Incendiaries were the Preaching Friers and Monks, who in lieu of obedience and conformity to Government, and compliance with the King, having ſo many Irons in the fire, did teach, and obtrude to the people nothing more than common Priviledge, and reſumption of Liberty, whereby the affection of the Vaſſal was withdrawn from his Prince.</p>
               <p>There came a Meſſenger of State to <hi>Paris,</hi> who brought news of the Great <hi>Turks</hi> death in the flower of his youth, though of a robuſt conſtitution. He died by exceſs of drinking ſome ſorts of Wine, wherewith he was uſed to be oft diſtempered, not withſtanding the ſtrict Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who often Preached this Doctrine, <hi>That there was a Devil in every berry of the Grape;</hi> and therefore abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicted the uſe of Wine in his <hi>Alchoran.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Soon after <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Braganſa</hi> was (upon a general revolt of the <hi>Portugueſes</hi>) within leſs than a month fully ſetled in the Kingdoms of <hi>Portugal</hi> and the <hi>Algarves,</hi> without any oppoſition at all. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt of <hi>Portugal</hi> was no great news to the <hi>French</hi> Cardinal, who had his ſpirits walking there, as well as in <hi>Barcelona,</hi> and every where elſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadours negotiate at <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Duke of <hi>Braganſa</hi> be Excommunicated for an Uſurper. If this had taken effect, it had made the King of <hi>France</hi> incapable to aſſiſt him being an Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated perſon. But <hi>France</hi> had ſuch a powerful Faction in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory, and the Pope was ſuch a friend to the <hi>French,</hi> that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique King could do little good in this point.</p>

And ſhe was uſed to ſay, that the worſt thing ſhe ever did was the advancement of <hi>Richlieu.</hi> In the ſenſe of this indignation ſhe forſook <hi>France,</hi> and drew a voluntary Exile upon her ſelf.

               <p>
                  <hi>Richlieu</hi> was no great Zealot in his own Religion, but as he made it ſubſervient to his political ends: nor would he ever employ any Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite: He had a moderate opinion of the Reformiſts, which made him to be called the <hi>Hugonot Cardinal.</hi> And he would have often in his mouth this ſaying, <hi>Maneat moralis benevolentia, inter diſcordes ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia.</hi> Yet he wrote a Book againſt them, which is extant. He did them more miſchief by Complementing with them, than by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating.</p>
               <p>He was a great cheriſher and promoter of vertuous men, and would find them out whereſoever they were, inſomuch that he gave every year in Penſions little leſs than an hundred thouſand Franks.

               <p>He died at <hi>Paris December</hi> 4. 1642. in the 57. year, and third month of his Age.</p>
               <p>After the deceaſe of <hi>Richlieu,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Julius Mazarin,</hi> a Gentleman of an ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Extraction, was put to ſit at the Helm. He toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Leo Bouthiller Chavigni,</hi> and <hi>Soublet Noyer,</hi> both Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of State, were the Cabinet Counſel to the King. <hi>Mazarin</hi> was a boſom friend, and a great intrinſick Confident of <hi>Richlieu</hi> before, who had imparted his deſigns, infuſed all his Maxims into him, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him all the <hi>Arcana Imperii.</hi> He had been an active Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Inſtrument employ'd by the Pope before in ſundry Treaties, and difficult traverſes of State, wherein he had good ſucceſs, and in all his negotiations he was diſcovered to be a Perſon of excellent addreſs and rare endowments.</p>
               <p>Five months after the death of Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> the King fell ſick at S. <hi>German</hi>'s, and died on <hi>May</hi> 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1643. the ſame month, the ſame day of the month, and about the ſame hour of the day that his Father died thirty three years before, but with this mark of difference, that the one went out, the other was ſent out of the world about the ſame time. His bowels were preſently carried to be interred at Saint <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> whither his Body followed after in the height of all ſolemnity
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:95405:202"/> and magnificence that his Queen could deviſe, whom he left Regent of the Realm.</p>
               <p>He was a great Zealot in the Religion and Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> When the Queen found her ſelf quick, he caus'd a ſolemn Declaration to be publiſhed, wherein he made the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Protectreſs under the holy Trinity of all his Eſtates, all which he conſecrated to her: and for an immortal Mark of this Conſecration, he commanded the great Altar in the Cathedral Church of <hi>Paris</hi> to be built anew, with the Image of the Virgin, which ſhould hold in her Arms that of our Saviour; and the K. to lie proſtrate before the Son and Mother, offering them his Crown and Scepter. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> was enjoyn'd to Commemorate this Declaration once every year upon Aſſumption-day at the Altar in the Morning; and that in the Evening a general Proceſſion ſhould be made, wherein the Provoſt of <hi>Paris,</hi> and all the Soveraign Companies ſhould be aſſiſtant with the Court of Parliament.

               </p>
               <p>He put out ſundry Proclamations againſt Swearers, againſt Pride in apparel, as alſo againſt Duels: and the laſt was ſo ſtrict, That both the appellant and defendent whoſoever did ſurvive, ſhould ſuffer death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy, and be deprived of Chriſtian burial, but both rot upon the Gallows with their heels upwards.</p>

                  <hi>Mazarine</hi> caſting with himſelf what is hutful and profitable, paſt this ſentence upon the Clergy.</p>
               <p>Theſe are his words counſelling the Queen Regent: The Sacred Order for theſe many years hath had but a thin harveſt of excellent Perſons, however it come to paſs. Men follow after nice Queſtions, live idly, do not embrace ſerious Studies. All is done with pomp, nay if any Sermons be to be made, and the very venerable ſacrifice offered. Of their Office they lay claim to nothing but their Rents: the duty of Preaching, which is the principal dignity of a Biſhop, they quit to any one though never ſo inſufficient. They think themſelves Biſhop enough, if they can but ride in fine Coaches with their Arms ſet on, out-vie one another in rich Liveries and Lacquies, and puniſh with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour thoſe that tranſgreſs in the leaſt matters. Perpetual haunters of Ladies Couches, not without undervaluing the Paſtoral ſtaff. This is
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:95405:203"/> for the moſt part, for there are ſome that lead holy and unreprovable lives. He that ſhall take offence, will own himſelf not to be one of theſe, but thoſe other. So much power hath Religion over the minds of men, that as often as among men in holy Orders any eminent vertue hath got up, and overcome the common attainments and the vices of mankind, it is adored like a Deity. At that time that company was of no weight nor moment in <hi>France,</hi> ſaid <hi>Mazarine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was <hi>Francis Paul Gondy,</hi> by extraction a <hi>Florentine,</hi> but born in <hi>France,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Rhetz,</hi> afterwards Coadjutor to the Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Corinth,</hi> one that if occaſion had offered, would have aſpired high, as Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> confeſſed he was perſwaded. Over and above an honourable Family, he had eloquence and learning with promptneſs of ſpirit.</p>
               <p>All was now proſperous and quiet in <hi>France,</hi> whoſe power reached over <hi>Almania</hi> from the <hi>Mazelin</hi> Brink beyond the <hi>Rhine.</hi> By the Victory at <hi>Norlingue,</hi> the parts confining on the <hi>Danube,</hi> were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards invaded, and terror ſtruck on all ſides. In <hi>Spain</hi> by ſeizing <hi>Tortoſa</hi> and <hi>Flix</hi> the <hi>French</hi> got to the River <hi>Iber.</hi> Their Fleets ranged over the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> and <hi>Ocean.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All <hi>Italy,</hi> from the Pope (who then was <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII) to the leaſt Princes, bore reverence. The Dukes of <hi>Savoy, Mantua,</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena,</hi> then rather Inſtruments of <hi>French</hi> ſlavery, than free Princes. The Kings of <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> boaſted of their friendſhip: the <hi>Pole</hi> ſued for it. The Electors of <hi>Germany</hi> ſought to intereſt themſelves in their favour. <hi>Portugal</hi> rent from <hi>Spain,</hi> depended on the looks of <hi>France,</hi> whoſe Yoak <hi>Catalonia</hi> had put on, being weary of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dominion. The Low Countries ſtuck cloſe to them: All <hi>Europe</hi> with aſtoniſhment ſtood gazing at ſuch a ſtate of the <hi>French</hi> affairs: nothing was then wanting to compleat their happineſs beſides moderation, and the art enjoying it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul Gondy</hi> deſigned Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> is conſecrated of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> (it is the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s practice, that ſo the whole world may be thought depending on the <hi>Vatican</hi> Oracle, to exerciſe his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority even upon the diſſenting parts.) That day was firſt occaſion of much enſuing miſchief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ferraro Pallavicini,</hi> a Canon Regular, a <hi>Parmeſan,</hi> of a Noble houſe, ſharply inveighing in libellous Pamphlets againſt the practices of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court, loſt his Head at <hi>Agivnon</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and gave in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance how unſafe a thing it is to touch upon the <hi>Roman</hi> State in writing, though never ſo truly.</p>
               <p>The Diviſions of <hi>Italy</hi> being cloſed up, Pope <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. died <hi>July</hi> 29. 1644. after he had ſate twenty one years and ſome months.</p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:95405:204"/>
               <p>Then <hi>Gio Battiſta Pamphilio,</hi> a Noble <hi>Roman,</hi> was Proclaimed Pope, after the See had been vacant 45. daies. He aſſumed the name of <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> the Tenth.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Hiſt. of Cardinals <hi>part.</hi> 3. <hi>lib.</hi> 2.</note>This Election was not at all diſpleaſing to the <hi>French,</hi> though they were not a little diſpleaſed at Cardinal <hi>Antonio,</hi> who for his own private Intereſt had by his reiterated inſtances perſwaded that Crown to the excluſion of <hi>Pamphilio,</hi> and afterwards conſented to it contrary to the King's order, and without expecting the return of the Currier, which was diſpatched to that Court, that they might conſult upon the buſineſs. For which the <hi>French</hi> King though fit to degrade Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> from the honour he poſſeſſed of being Protector of <hi>France,</hi> and to take away his Royal favour from <hi>Teodoli,</hi> and the Marqueſs of <hi>San Vito</hi> his Brother, and to recal his Ambaſſadour <hi>San Simon</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> to render an account of his proceedings; yet in the mean time the moſt Chriſtian, King fail'd not with all actions of goodneſs and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity to endeavour a correſpondence with the Perſon and Houſe of the new Pope, giving him to underſtand that the chaſtiſement of the aforeſaid perſons, proceeded from the averſion they had to his Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: or at leaſt for that they had perſwaded that Crown to his excluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with arguments much contrary to the truth.</p>
               <p>About the end of the year 1646. died <hi>Henry Bourbon</hi> Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi> not yet ſixty years old. Nothing was more methodical than the whole courſe of his life: every action had its proper ſeaſon, and each year they returned in their due Periods, as by a Kalendar.</p>
               <p>The young King fell dangerouſly ſick of the ſmall Pox, but he recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and grew up under the inſtructions of <hi>Hardovin Perefix</hi> Abbot of <hi>Beaumont,</hi> a man of a pleaſant gravity and wiſdom, afterwards Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> who might have been ſtiled the King's <hi>Seneca,</hi> but that he hapned upon a <hi>Trajan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the year 1647. Whores and Bawds of all ſorts were baniſhed out of <hi>Paris;</hi> not by an Act of Parliament, but by an Order of the Provoſt Mareſchal.</p>
               <p>A Writer of that ſtory ſaith, It was a ſhameful thing to ſtir thoſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which having been ſtirred would have ſtunk filthily; and to be fierce againſt poor Whores, when Noble Ladies did proſtitute them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Mazarine</hi> furniſhed a Library in favour of the Studious with Books to be read over in many ages. One might behold ſhelves raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to the top of the Roof, where through a luxUry of literature was ſet up a learned Pile not as Ornaments of a Palace, but as Inſtruments of Wiſdom, not ranked for a ſhew, but for uſe.</p>
               <p>In the year 1648. a Civil War in <hi>France</hi> was unfortunately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, and all <hi>France</hi> was ſet in a combuſtion. At the ſame time a
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:95405:204"/> malignant Star did influence many Kingdoms, as <hi>England, Naples, Catalonia, Portugal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Great commotions were in <hi>Paris. Peter Seguier</hi> Chancellour of <hi>France,</hi> is diſpatched to the Parliament, to carry them the King's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or in truth, to try what was their intention.</p>
               <p>He was like to be torn in pieces by the Rabble. But <hi>Milleray</hi> on Horſeback with <hi>Dort,</hi> break through the Seditious crew, and having reſcued the Chancellour from that imminent danger, convey him back ſafe to the Queen in a Coach half-torn, the Guard being frighted, and ſome of them ſlain. The Sedition breaks out farther, and the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the people riſeth to higher exaſperation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>F. Paul Gondy,</hi> deſigned Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> (commonly ſtyled Coadjutor) in his Pontifical Robes, carrying with him a veneration as he paſſed along the Streets, moderated the people with Language and geſture. Some there were that taxed <hi>Gondy,</hi> as if in his heart he had been ſomewhat favouring alterations. However the matters were in truth, that was the firſt day of <hi>Gondy</hi>'s withdrawing, and the cauſe of all thoſe evils, which that Prelate eminent in Mind, Birth, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, fell into afterwards: from this time he ſhall be ever after called the Archbiſhop of <hi>Corinth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mazarine</hi> took care to have the King conveyed to <hi>Ruel,</hi> two miles out of Town, under pretence of taking the Air. The Ring-leaders of the Sedition fretted, and could not digeſt to have the King reſcued from their fury. The firſt remarkable Act of the retirement to <hi>Ruel,</hi> was the impriſonment and banifſment of <hi>Chavigny.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here begins a general ſtorm to gather over <hi>Mazarine. Orleans</hi> ſteps in as a Mediator between Court and Parliament. <hi>Conde</hi> returned from the <hi>Campaigne,</hi> elated with his freſh Victory, at firſt dealt rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Senate, afterwards flattered their Loaders: pretended at leaſt to Conſtable or Admiral. <hi>Longueville</hi> inſtigated his Brother-in-Law, boaſting that he had obtained <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> the famous ſtrength of <hi>Normandy,</hi> ſo taking occaſion to fall from his former Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Corinth</hi> put <hi>Longuevillo</hi> on to ſuch courſes, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a vain expectation, as if he ſhould be declared by an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Prince of the blood. Anne Bourbon,</hi> the, Wife of <hi>Longueville,</hi> was of great moment to the Faction: ſhe carried along with her the Archbiſhop of <hi>Corinth,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Retz,</hi> her Bro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her <hi>Conti,</hi> with <hi>Rochfoucault,</hi> who was then that Ladies Cabinet Counſellour. Thoſe all pretended the publick and private good. That their Tyranny muſt be abated with Arms, who had put the King upon cruel Counſels, and rendred the Princes odious to him, and ſuſpected.</p>
               <p>The Queen ſees her ſelf ſtruck at through the ſides of <hi>Mazarine.</hi> She compoſeth her mind, recollecting her thoughts how to provide for the future. <hi>Mazarine</hi> applies his mind to an accomodation.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:95405:205"/> The ſubſtance of the Articles was, That many Taxes were to be abated in Towns and Countrey: The Provinces were to be eaſed of them by the Maſters of Requeſts: no man might be kept in Priſon above the ſpace of one natural day, without anſwering to his charge in the Houſe: which was eagerly diſputed and approved even by the Court Party. <hi>Chavigny</hi> is releaſed, and turns aſide to <hi>Tours.</hi> Thus the firſt heat of <hi>Paris</hi> was aſſwaged. About the end of <hi>October</hi> the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Faction having got ſtrength through his Majeſtie's Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the obtaining their Petitions, as being now eſtabliſhed by Law, maketh the former conceſſions but a ſtep to higher demands. The Parliament boiled up with new deſigns. The ſtorm of envy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth it ſelf on <hi>Mazarine:</hi> it is openly cried out, <hi>That the Axe muſt be laid to the root; the Stranger muſt be expelled out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> At length the Thunder-clap broke over the head of <hi>Mazarine.</hi> He is Voted in a full Houſe guilty of High Treaſon, and the diſturber of the publick Peace. Every Age, Condition, Sex, is commanded to aſſault, ſhoot, or ſtab him: Whoever harboured him in the ſame houſe with them, ſhould be guilty of the ſame Crime with him. In the City came out divers libels againſt <hi>Mazarine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On <hi>December</hi> 26. <hi>Monſieur du Boſquet</hi> (heretofore Lord Chief-Juſtice in the Province of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> as alſo for that of <hi>Guienne</hi>) had the Biſhoprick of <hi>Lodeva</hi> beſtowed upon him by his Majeſty, and was tranſmitted into holy Orders, and after conſecrated by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Narbonne,</hi> having for his Aſſiſtants, the Biſhops of <hi>Beziers</hi> and <hi>Alez.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then was a Letter ſent from the Court of Parliament at <hi>Paris,</hi> to all Majors, Bailifs, Sheriffs, and other publick Officers in the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> craving of them to aid and aſſiſt the City of <hi>Paris</hi> with ſuch Proviſions whereof it might ſtand in need, and with ſupplies of men and other War-like neceſſaries, to preſerve the City for his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie's ſervice. They declared, that <hi>Mazarine</hi> as an utter enemy to the Kingdom, ſought by all means, yea by open violence and force of Arms, to ſuppreſs the King's Authority, that of their Court, with the publick liberty. And to that effect had cauſed the City of <hi>Paris</hi> to be inveſted, and the King to be conveyed from thence at two of the clock in the morning. Upon the news of theſe combuſtions in <hi>Paris</hi> at <hi>Rome, Monſieur Mazarine</hi> wrote to his Son the Cardinal, telling him of his faults, and giving his Fatherly advice.</p>
               <p>The Court now between <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Roven</hi> (the two moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Cities of the Kingdom) was diſtreſſed with the want of all things, eſpecially of money, the Aids coming in but ſlowly from all parts. The City Militia grew every day more unwilling to ſubmit to Orders: and all people were full of murmuring complaints. Thereupon the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:95405:205"/> Archbiſhop of <hi>Corinth</hi> gets up into the Pulpit at St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> and ſaith; <hi>I would have had you in ſafety; I would have had you Victorious; and the goodneſs of the cauſe had acquitted you, unleſs your repentance and tameneſs did plead guilty.</hi> Then having inveighed much againſt the Government and <hi>Mazarine,</hi> he cometh down out of the Pulpit: and having put off his Mitre and Surplice, he putteth on his Armour. Often he ſallied out of the Town to charge the Enemy, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his Function. Great uproars and tumults followed; but at St. <hi>Germans</hi> the principal Lords of the King's Council did earneſtly treat of Peace with the Parliaments Commiſſioners, <hi>Mazarine</hi> being excluded, as already pre-condemned by publick Acts, ſome Courtiers driving that way, that they might engroſs to themſelves the honour of having procured the quiet of the State. The Queen oppoſed it ſtrongly, and at length when he was taken in <hi>March</hi> 11. 1649. the Articles were agreed to the great joy of the Common people. <hi>That an Act of Oblivion for paſt miſcarriages be made. That all things be reſtored to their former eſtate. That the King be brought home again to</hi> Paris. <hi>Taxes to be diminiſhed. A Treaty of Peace with the</hi> Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard <hi>conſented to: and ſome Worſhipful Member of the Houſe for Age and Experience, be joyned in the tranſaction, to ſee it concluded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good and firm terms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Sedition at <hi>Paris</hi> was ſcarce quiet, but the Faction works in new Plots. There is a Riſing in <hi>Provence,</hi> and eſpecially in <hi>Guienne</hi> againſt their Governours, which <hi>Conde</hi> underhand abetteth. <hi>Conde, Conti,</hi> and <hi>Longueville,</hi> are impriſoned. Thrice they alter their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in thirteen months. Various tranſactions paſſed in the mean time in <hi>Normandy, Burgundy,</hi> and <hi>Guienne.</hi> Great conteſts there were either about releaſing or detaining the Priſoners. The Cardinal and the Slingers fell at odds, ſo as to betray one another, and treat with the Priſoners about Marriages, and in a manner ſharing the whole Kingdom. At length a Peace is concluded and publiſhed on <hi>Auguſt</hi> 2. 1650. and all things are ſetled in <hi>Guienne.</hi> The King enters the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> with a Guard of four thouſand choice men. The Cardinal had Lodgings with the King in the Archbiſhop's Palace. <hi>Eſpernon</hi> the cauſe of the Inſurrection, was excluded, who might by his ſingle vertue purchaſe a Government. The Life-Guards were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed, and the King truſted himſelf to the Guard of his Subjects. Which took much with their Ambitious temper. The Court parted from thence. The King ſtayed at <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> all being in an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar in <hi>Paris;</hi> at his ſucceſs in <hi>Guienne,</hi> the Faction were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged.</p>
               <p>On <hi>November</hi> 15. 1650. <hi>Conde, Conti,</hi> and <hi>Longueville,</hi> were conveyed in eleven daies journey through the midſt of <hi>Normandy</hi> to <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> where they were kept in cloſe cuſtody. <hi>Harcourt</hi>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:95405:206"/> ſecured the conveyance with four hundred Horſe, and the like number of Foot.</p>
               <p>On <hi>February</hi> 6. 1651. in a dark night the Cardinal <hi>Incognito,</hi> in a diſguiſed habit guarded by about 200. Horſe, riding himſelf on horſeback, retired to St. <hi>Germans, Harcourt</hi> beating the way. He purſues his journey through the midſt of <hi>Normandy</hi> to <hi>Havre de Grace</hi> with a pompous train, gazed at by all the people as he paſſed along. <hi>Mazarine</hi> having diſpoſed his Cavalry into the neighbouring Villages, enters into <hi>Havre de Grace</hi> with his retinue of menial ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. He goes into the Caſtle alone with only two others, he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the Queens Letters to the Governour for the releaſing of the Princes, which was done accordingly. <hi>Longueville</hi> went out firſt, then <hi>Conti,</hi> and both of them leaped into <hi>Grammont</hi>'s Coach. <hi>Conde</hi> ſtaid a little while after with the Cardinal in the Priſon Chamber, where they had Conference together.</p>
               <p>The enlarged Princes return to <hi>Paris,</hi> where the Souldiery at the ſight of <hi>Conde</hi> weep for joy. Great was the concourſe of the City, and ſo great was the joy, as though the Pillars were reſtored to the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mazarine</hi> withdraws from <hi>France,</hi> and comes in ſafety to <hi>Brovel,</hi> the Palace of the Elector of <hi>Cologn.</hi> Thence he writes to the Queen, and the Count <hi>de Brienne,</hi> his Majeſtie's Secretary. This Letter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing read with an audible voice in the Privy Council, brought ſome to relent, but exaſperated more. <hi>Mazarine</hi> is Voted in a full houſe guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of High Treaſon, the diſturber of the publick peace, and enemy of <hi>France.</hi> Strict prohibitions are made, that no <hi>French</hi> man ſhould hold correſpendence with him, impoſing a ſevere penalty on all that ſhould preſume to tranſgreſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mazarine</hi> was in ill condition, againſt whoſe return were ſtrict Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, to which the Queen Regent gave her aſſent: nay by Act of Parliament, not only foreign but home-born Cardinals and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticks, in what degree ſoever dignified, are rendred uncapable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admitted Members of the King's Council. No man can pay a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Allegiance to his natural Sovereign, and the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> For Cardinals, if the account be rightly caſt up, are but Curates in Purple. They ſhould attend the Conſiſtories, and over-ſee their Flock, the charge whereof cannot be neglected without the hazard of ſouls. <hi>Corinth</hi> drew againſt the Bill, that only foreigners ſhould be excluded from the Government, leſt his expected Hat not being lined with that Miniſtry to which he aſpired, might be depreſſed by his meaner contemplations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obuſſon,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Yverdon,</hi> in behalf of the Clergy made an eloquent Oration for the priviledges of the Church, but without ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. Yet the reputation of <hi>Obuſſon</hi> grew by this means higher, and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:95405:206"/> paved him a path to future preferments. The main ſcope of his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lay in amplifying the obligations that <hi>Cardinals</hi> had laid upon <hi>France,</hi> whoſe good ſervices were conſpicuous all over the World. The Parliament anſwered, that the ſame Cardinals were inſatiable in Ambition and Covetouſneſs. This (ſaid they) is incident to Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical dignities, a ſlighting of heavenly matters, and an affectation of domineering on earth, and eminency over great Princes, in all which they write after the Copy, and come as near as they can to the Roman Court, overcoming all the world in pride. They added, that they turn the greatneſs they have received againſt their very benefactors, and aim at nothing leſs by their Canoniſts and Emiſſaries, than the total ſuppreſſion of the Secular power. That if their immoderate advance proceed, the Authority of Church-men will become Empreſs of the world, and the Secular power muſt be its Lacquey, which is ſcandalous.</p>
               <p>The Queen tolerated theſe and ſuch like diſorders, and others che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed them. The Parliament condemned them as prejudicial to their Authority. The Princes could not well digeſt the hardineſs of the Parliament of <hi>Paris.</hi> The Council of the <hi>Nobles</hi> ſlighted both Court and Parliament, and joyned with the Clergy. <hi>Conde</hi> removes divers Miniſters of State. He takes the Government of <hi>Guienne,</hi> rejecting his preſent one of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> He withdraws from Court. The Civil commotions break out afreſh, and a third <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> war ariſeth. Now <hi>Mazarine</hi> is revoked upon this ground, to ſuccour the King, who was again diſtreſſed by the faction.</p>
               <p>The day of the Kings Majority approached; The King with the Queen Regent came into the Parliament on <hi>September</hi> 7. 1651. with a ſolemn pomp. The Queen having made a ſhort recital of her Regency, delivereth up her Government to her Son.</p>
               <p>The firſt Action of the new King was to fall on <hi>Conde</hi>'s Forces at <hi>Marle, Guiſe</hi> and <hi>Vervain.</hi> They were partly routed, and ſome ſlain; part under the command of <hi>Tavan</hi> recovered <hi>Stenay.</hi> From thence was the riſe of the Civil War.</p>
               <p>Then did <hi>Corinth</hi> compaſs that Hat ſo often promiſed, and ſo often put by; which Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> granted, not ſo much for gratifying the King, as the eclipſing <hi>Mazarine,</hi> by ſetting up an equal to him in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. No longer is he called <hi>Corinth,</hi> but <hi>de Rhetz</hi> ſhall he be hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter called.</p>
               <p>The King leaving <hi>St. Germans,</hi> goes and falls upon <hi>Conde</hi>'s Forces at <hi>Eſtampes.</hi> They having barricadoed up the place, make a ſtout de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and elude the aſſaults of <hi>Thurenne,</hi> who upon the approach of the Lorrainer is forced to draw off, and convey ths King to <hi>Corbeil.</hi> The Armies meet, and fight from five in the morning till five in the evening with great fury. There were ſlain on both ſides men of quality, beſides an innumerable company of common ſouldiers. The port of S. <hi>Anthony</hi>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:95405:207"/> being clear, <hi>Conde</hi> with his mangled Retinue comes into the City. <hi>Conde</hi> draws off into <hi>Flanders.</hi> And <hi>Mazarine</hi> counterfeits a depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into <hi>Spain,</hi> to divert the blame of the troubles upon <hi>Conde</hi> alone: The faction declines: The King returneth to <hi>Paris. Orleans</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth without waiting on the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>De Rhetz</hi> is impriſoned at <hi>Vincennes.</hi> He was brought to <hi>Nantes,</hi> and he eſcapes from thence, and afterwards aſſiſted at <hi>Rome</hi> at the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> VII. Then returning to <hi>France,</hi> he volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily laid down the Arch-biſhoprick of <hi>Paris</hi> to gratifie the King: he lives quietly, in ſplendour ſuitable to his diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mazarin</hi> after his return purſues nothing ſo eagerly as the peace, ſetleth <hi>France,</hi> makes a peace with <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and reduceth his enemies to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1656"/> Complaint was made unto the King againſt the Proteſtants of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Montauban,</hi> accuſing them for beating a Prieſt, and making a tumult, to the breach of the Kings peace. The King upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the Clergy appointed Monſieur <hi>Melian</hi> maſter of <hi>Requeſts,</hi> by ſpecial commiſſion to go and make enquiry at <hi>Montauban,</hi> touching the truth of what paſſed there between the Proteſtants and the Catholicks. Whereof the Deputy of the Proteſtants reſiding at <hi>Paris</hi> being inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he addreſſed himſelf to Monſieur <hi>Melian,</hi> and gave him an account of all paſſages according to the teſtimonies and depoſitions that had been already taken about me buſineſs: as how that they were moſt of them Papiſts that were in the Tumult at the death of the Woman. And in eaſe this were not true, then he deſired himſelf might ſuffer the ſame puniſhment that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ffenders do deſerve. In the mean time he prayed the ſaid Commiſſioner, that the Proteſtants might have a full and fair hearing from him, when he ſhould arrive at <hi>Montauban.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1656. the Aſſembly of the Clergy ſitting in <hi>Paris,</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that the Deputies of the Province of <hi>Paris</hi> ſhould go to Court, to repreſent to his Majeſty the ſtate of the Church of <hi>Paris,</hi> &amp; the great need that there was of his countenance and direction to put all things in order.</p>
               <p>The Deputies of the ſaid Aſſembly having conferred with the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, and the other Miniſters of State there reſiding, could not then come to any concluſion upon thoſe pretenſions which the Clergy alledged againſt thoſe of the Reformed Religion. And therefore the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Sens,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Montpelier,</hi> and two Abbots, ſpent ſome time at Court to ſollicite the King to put forth ſome Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in favour of the Clergy and Catholick Religion. <hi>Madam,</hi> the Dutcheſs of <hi>Orleans</hi> arrived at <hi>Chartres</hi> to perform a Vow which ſhe h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d made, which was, that once every year ſhe would viſit the Church of <hi>Chartres,</hi> there to make her devotion.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Auguſt</hi> 9. the Deputies of the Aſſembly of the Clergy went with the Chancellour, to conſider of the differences and quarrels which they
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:95405:207"/> had againſt thoſe of the Reformed Religion, the King having deputed the Chancellour to joyn with them in the examination of that buſineſs.</p>
               <p>In the ſame month the Biſhhop of <hi>Chartres</hi> died at <hi>Paris.</hi> He had been Confeſſour to Cardinal <hi>Richlieu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was then affirmed by letters from <hi>Paris,</hi> that the King had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to a declaration drawn up in favour of the Clergy and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, to be preſented to the Parliament for their verification, revoking his declaration of the year 1652. which was made in favour of the Proteſtants.</p>
               <p>The Abbot of <hi>Marolles</hi> was apprehended, and ſent priſoner to the <hi>Baſtille</hi> for words ſpoken againſt Cardinal <hi>Mazarine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſtiana,</hi> late Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> having renounced the Proteſtant Religion, and revolted to the Catholick Religion, came into <hi>France,</hi> and on <hi>September</hi> 4. 1656. lodged at <hi>Fontainbleau,</hi> where ſhe was complemented with an Oration by the Sieur <hi>Hambrocus,</hi> the Kings Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour extraordinary for the Hebrew, Syriack, and Arabick Tongues, he being preſented to her by the Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi> On the ſixth ſhe was at the Houſe of Monſieur <hi>Heſſelin,</hi> who entertained her with all manner of divertiſements in that moſt delicious place. On the ſeventh ſhe was at <hi>Conflans</hi> in the houſe of the Duke of <hi>Richlieu;</hi> where ſhe was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe very nobly treated by the Duke and Ducheſs, who at night gave her a Comedy. On the eighth ſhe made her entrance into <hi>Paris</hi> on Horſeback, paſſing through ten thouſand Citizens who ſtood in Armes to receive her. Before her went an hundred Switzers of the Kings Guard, with drums beating. At the Gate of S. <hi>Anthony</hi> ſhe had a ſpeech made her by the <hi>Sieur de Seve,</hi> Provoſt of Merchants, in head of all the companies of the City. Then ſhe marched on (with a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopy carried over her, the great Guns being diſcharged, and the Streets all adorned with rich hangings) towards the Church of <hi>Noſtre-Dame.</hi> At the entrance whereof ſhe was entertained with an Oration by the Dean, all the Clergy giving attendance, and then paſſing to the Quire, they ſang <hi>Te Deum</hi> with admirable muſick: after which ſhe was moſt magnificently conducted to the <hi>Louvre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Archbiſhop of <hi>Roven</hi> having moſt unjuſtly proſecuted an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of that Parliament, called Monſieur <hi>de Cognard,</hi> a Profeſſour of the Reformed Religion, for writing a Book by order and with approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Synod of <hi>Normandy,</hi> in anſwer to a book full of calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and falſities, written by a Phyſitian of that place, who from a Proteſtant had a little before turned Papiſt: And the ſaid Archbiſhop by his violent perſecution having obliged the ſaid <hi>Cognard</hi> to leave this City: by a juſt judgement of God, who uſeth ordinarily to puniſh men in the very things wherein they have ſinned, He the ſaid Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop fell into the ſame pit which he had digged for another, having at <hi>Roven</hi> publiſhed a moſt dangerous Pamphlet, containing this ſeditious
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:95405:208"/> doctrine, That it is lawful to fall on the Hereticks; and granting ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his Archiepiſcopal authority or otherwiſe, an Indulgence or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of an hundred years to any one that ſhould fall on any pretended Heretick. This curſed doctrine coming to the knowledge of the French Court; and the dangerous conſequences of it having been there ſeriouſly weighed, the King ſent order to the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> Governour of that Province, to apprehend the ſaid Archbiſhop: but he timely hearing of it, ran away, and abſented himſelf from thence.</p>
               <p>An Engliſh man was impriſoned at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> having been taken as he was endeavouring to ſeduce divers perſons to turn to the Sect and Opinions of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> a thing not heard of in <hi>France</hi> before that time.</p>
               <p>Great talk was in <hi>Paris</hi> of a Miracle, which (they ſay) hapned in the Monaſtery of Port-royal in that City, upon one that was a Penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner belonging to that Monaſtery, who was ſaid to have been cured of a Fiſtula in the eye, called <hi>Fiſtula lachrymalis,</hi> by the touch of one of the thorns, which the Prieſts ſay was taken out of the Crown of our bleſſed Saviour: But how it came into <hi>France</hi> I cannot tell you. And albeit in this prying age the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not been very forward to broach any new miracles, eſpecially on this ſide the Alpes, yet this hath been much cried up. The Grand Vicar of the Arch-biſhoprick of <hi>Paris</hi> was the firſt that was Patron of it, and afterward it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the Curat of <hi>S. Severin</hi> the preſent grand Vicar, aſſiſted therein by five Doctors of the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> and a publick maſs and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving was celebrated for it. Hereupon many were drawn to the ſaid Monaſtery to be cured by the holy Thorn.</p>
               <p>The Aſſembly of the Clergy lay ſo heavy with their importunities upon the King, that it was yielded at length, that a Declaration ſhould be iſſued forth, contrary to the ſence of former Declarations, which were made in favour of the Proteſtants. Hereupon the Parliament of <hi>Tholouſe</hi> proceeded ſo far, as to ratifie the ſaid Declaration againſt the Proteſtants of <hi>France,</hi> and ordered that two Counſellours ſhould go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to upper and lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> to put it in Execution; and to cauſe ſuch Churches to be demoliſhed as had been built ſince the Wars.</p>
               <p>Soon after the Biſhop of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> died, a Prelate of much reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who had ſerved King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. in the quality of Almoner. He was promoted to the ſaid Biſhoprick in the year 1623. He had the honour to conſecrate the preſent King at his Coronation. Since the Declaration forementioned, another Declaration of the French King was publiſhed at <hi>Paris</hi> in behalf of the Proteſtants, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating that the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> ſhould be punctually obſerved: and that two Commiſſioners, one Proteſtant, one Papiſt, ſhould repair to the places where any innovations, or contraventions had been made, to reform the ſame.</p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:95405:208"/>
               <p>Some Biſhops of the Aſſembly of the Clergy, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauban</hi> and <hi>Alby,</hi> repreſented to the ſaid Aſſembly, that the anſwer made in the behalf of the Proteſtants to the late ſpeech of the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Sens,</hi> ought to be burnt, as a Book pernicious and injurious to the King, as they reported; and other Biſhops affirming the contrary, for the proving of the truth, the ſame anſwer was read in their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by the Secretary from one end to the other: and upon reading of it the Aſſembly concluded, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t there was no juſt ground therein to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of it to the King; and ſo the ſaid Aſſembly diſſolved without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting the buſineſs any farther at that time.</p>
               <p>Not long after, a certain Popiſh Prieſt diſcourſing one day with a <hi>French</hi> Proteſtant, with deſign to draw him over to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> he thought he had brought him into a very hopeful way, when the Proteſtant had told him, that all the Proteſtants in <hi>France</hi> would ſubmit themſelves to the Pope, if the Pope would ſubmit himſelf to the Councils: to whom the Prieſt replyed, it will be neceſſary then that a Council be called, and ſuch rules eſtabliſhed by common conſent, as ſhall be thought neceſſary for the Government of the Church. To which the Proteſtant replyed a little fiercely, <hi>How will the Pope obſerve the Decrees of a Council, that cannot be kept <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

               </p>
               <p>After the taking of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> and put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the <hi>Engliſh, Crequi</hi> is ſent Embaſſador to <hi>O. Cromwel,</hi> with <hi>Mazarine</hi>'s Nephew in his pompous train: <hi>Cromwel</hi> died not long after.</p>
               <p>Divers places in <hi>Flanders</hi> were ſurrendered to the <hi>French:</hi> but amidſt theſe proſperous ſucceſſes the <hi>French</hi> King falls into a Fever at <hi>Calais,</hi> judged to be mortal. Supplications were made for him at all Altars, and prayers for his recovery were publickly enjoyned. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine</hi> day and night ſate by his bed ſide, to make him governable in taking Phyſick, which he would taſte himſelf, either to take off the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſantneſs, or to make proof of it. The eleventh day accounted Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, the King ſeemed at the point of death, could ſcarcely life up his eyes, that now appeared almoſt ſet in his head. His Majeſty having Antimony with judgement given him by <hi>Geunault,</hi> recovered; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conveyed to <hi>Paris,</hi> pay'd his Vows in <hi>Noſtre-Dame</hi> Church. An heart of maſſy Gold was hung upon the wall as an oblation: afterwards to confirm his health, he removed to <hi>Fontainbleau. Mazarine</hi> ſtayed ſome time behind to advance the ſiege of <hi>Graveling.</hi> The taking of <hi>Graveling</hi> was the laſt Monument of the <hi>French</hi> glory before the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the peace.</p>
               <p>At twenty four Seſſions the buſineſs of the peace between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> was compleated, and at length on <hi>November</hi> 7. 1659. the Articles
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:95405:209"/> agreed on by the two Miniſters, were ſigned, and publiſhed.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal at <hi>Tholouſe</hi> rendered the King and Queen an account of the peace concluded, whereat they received much ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>From hence the Court made a Progreſs into <hi>Provence</hi> (till the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould come with his daughter, who was to be married to the <hi>French</hi> King) to compoſe the diſorders at <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> which had broken out about the Priviledges of their Conſuls.</p>

                  <hi>Gaſton</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> born of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and <hi>Mary Medices,</hi> only Brother of King <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. having laid down the Civil Arms, would paſs off the diſcontents that were rifſn in his mind for the ill ſucceſs of his deſign, by retiring to <hi>Blois.</hi> On a ſudden he turns Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary and Herbaliſt; he delighted in Dogs and hunting, and ranging the Woods.

The Corpſe of <hi>Gaſton</hi> is depoſited at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Denis</hi> among the Tombs of his Anceſtors with a private burial.</p>
               <p>The Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> meet, and the <hi>French</hi> King is married to <hi>Maria Tereſa,</hi> daughter to the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Goſpels were laid on Stands on both ſides with a Crucifix. The Kings kneeling ſwore upon them, that they would religiouſly obſerve the Articles of the peace concluded, which were at the ſame moment read by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries.</p>
               <p>Theſe Kings having left the Iſland where they met, they were thus parted, never more to return to the ſight of one another. At S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>John de Luz,</hi> next day a ſolemn Wedding was kept with unuſual ſplendor. Then without any ſtay, that barren coaſt and unhoſpitable quarters are abandoned. The King and Queen ſtay a while at <hi>Fontainbleau,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by giving the <hi>Pariſians</hi> reſpite to provide for the pompous ſolemnity.

               <p>The entry was next to a triumph. In a <hi>Domo</hi> ſet up in the Suburb of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Anthony,</hi> both their Majeſties were congratulated by the ſeveral Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders coming forth decently marſhalled. Firſt came the Eccleſiaſticks carrying Images with them, and Antique Gods of rude workmanſhip. The Tradeſmen followed in their ſeveral Companies. Then proceeded the Magiſtrates; and afterwards the Parliament in their Robes. Next the Chancellor laid over with Gold, the Maſters of the Requeſts guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Royal Seal, charged upon an Horſe laden with trappings. The Soldiers and the Heralds in rich Coats. All had ſpotted Plumes in their Hats. The Captains marched in the Head of their Companies with the Enſigns. All ſorts of riches are diſplayed, and the ornaments of the City are brought forth to grace the publick joy.

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:95405:209"/> Steed, rode before. The Princes on Horſeback followed immediately after. In the way all along as they came were Quires of excellent Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, reſounding cheerful Airs in Conſorts of Inſtrumental and Vocal Melody. The new married Couple came amidſt this Pomp to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-Gate. At the entrance was ſet up aloft an Image of Peace, holding forth divers Verſes in its right hand. They proceeded from the Port through the High-Streets of the City unto the <hi>Louver</hi> even tired with joy.</p>
               <p>Scarce were ſix months expired after the Entry of the King, when <hi>Mazarine</hi> was taken deſperately with all the ſymptoms of extreameſt pain. His Liver and Lungs diſtempered, cauſed a general feebleneſs in all his limbs. The Phyſitians diſcovering there was no hope of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, he retireth to <hi>Vincennes,</hi> there to dye. The King commanded he ſhould be left to his reſt, and diſturbed with no buſineſs. He is reported to have ſuggeſted many things of the various Schemes of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy to the King, who commonly ſate by his bed ſide. Many ſecrets he inſtilled into the King, and wiſely admoniſhed him, That himſelf would undertake the Government of his State, and not create a publick jealouſie by ill-choſen Favourites. That he ſhould have the ſame <hi>Genius,</hi> and the ſame Divine aſſiſtance of his counſel, as he had to obtain his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. As they were thus diſcourſing together, many times he fainted away: All hope being paſt, the King departed. The ſame ſetled look which the Cardinal had when he was well, accompanyed him at his departure.</p>
               <p>He adopted <hi>Du Port,</hi> the only Son of <hi>Meillcray</hi> into the Priviledges of his blood, to whom he gave his Niece in marriage, and conveyed to him his Name and Arms, being for his merits taken into equal dearneſs, as if he had been his own Son. He advanced his Nephew <hi>Mancini</hi> in Lordſhips, Riches and Governments. Theſe were to ſhare equally. Of his Attendants and Menial Servants, ſcarce was any left without a Legacy.</p>
               <p>He ordered the building of a Colledge for the training up the youth of the gained Provinces, to have this <hi>Motto, A Monument of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire enlarged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He particularly recommended <hi>John Baptiſta Colbert,</hi> whom he loved for his many good qualities, unto the King. Having a vaſt quantity of Jewels, he diſtributed them among divers perſons. To the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> in teſtimony of injuries forgotten, he gave a Diamond of no mean price. To the King he left eighteen that were ineſtimable, ſtyled <hi>Mazarines,</hi> to propagate his Name and Renown to poſterity. He dyed on <hi>March</hi> 15. in the year of his life 59. of his power 18.</p>
               <p>He was obſervant of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, as to the Externals of it. Being near his end, he ſolemnly received the Euchariſt, and with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Litany received Extream Unction: and further requeſted, that Maſſes might be ſaid for him. All was diligently performed in the Temples, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:95405:210"/> the Hoaſt expoſed upon the Altars. Supplications were made before all the Saints. Zealous he was for the See of <hi>Rome</hi> beyond meaſure; and at his earneſt requeſt, the Pope's Nuntio bleſt him.</p>
               <p>After the death of <hi>Mazarine,</hi> the King's Cabinet Counſellers were <hi>Michael Tellier, Hugh Lyonne,</hi> both Secretaries of State, and <hi>John Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſta Colbert,</hi> Lord Treaſurer, men of great fame and vertue.</p>
               <p>At the end of the month of <hi>July</hi> 1661. <hi>Nicholas Fouquet</hi> was arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as he returned from the Kings Council. He was carried into the Caſtle of <hi>Angers,</hi> from thence to <hi>Vincennes,</hi> and at laſt to the <hi>Baſtile.</hi> His penalty at laſt was baniſhment.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniard</hi> having ſent their Miniſters into <hi>England,</hi> there aroſe a contention in <hi>London</hi> between <hi>Eſtrade</hi> the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Batteville</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, whoſe Coach ſhould take place in the proceeding. <hi>Batteville</hi> with his company falls violently upon the Attendants of <hi>Eſtrade,</hi> and wounds his Coachman and Horſes, and ſome of his Servants. The <hi>French</hi> King diſchargeth his indignation upon <hi>Batteville,</hi> and baniſheth Count <hi>Fuelſaldagne</hi> from the Verge of the Court, not reſpecting his integrity, and that he had been Conductor of the Queen, who was the Pledge of Peace. He alſo denyed <hi>Caracene</hi> (that was diſcharged of the Government of the <hi>Low Countreys</hi>) a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage through <hi>France;</hi> moreover he orders the Archbiſhop of <hi>Yverdon</hi> (who was then at <hi>Madrid</hi> upon the Kings account) not only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of King <hi>Philip</hi> himſelf, that <hi>Batteville</hi> might be puniſhed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the hainouſneſs of the offence: but to cut off all contention about precedency for the future, that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Renunciation of all Priority might be eſtabliſhed by a publick Act.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſs <hi>Fuentes</hi> is now ſent to <hi>Paris</hi> with a great Train. The King cauſeth the Popes Nuntio, the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Venice, Sweden, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> and all Forreign Miniſters, to be preſent; as alſo the Peers of the Realm, the Chancellor, and four Secretaries, to regiſter it. In this concourſe <hi>Fuentes</hi> thus ſpake to the King. <hi>There being nothing more upon the King my Maſters heart, than Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly to obſerve the Laws of Conſanguinity, He hath ſent me hither with a charge to confirm them, which at his Perſonal preſence he eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed with his Royal mouth. His Perſon I ſuſtain this day, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting a King, that knows not to yield, but a Father, whoſe ſpirit only nature works to a complyance. He hath thought fit voluntarily to quit to you thoſe Tranſitory honours which he hath enjoyed ſo long, ſince ſhortly death is liks to put a period to them: Theſe Gallantries may become your Age. Such youthful Ambition an old man, and your Father-in-law envies not. The</hi> London <hi>outrage hath ſunk deeper into his, than your heart. He could not more effectially redreſs it, than by puniſhing the Author. The revocation of</hi> Batteville, <hi>is a publick declaration of inflicting puniſhment on him. But what could have been added more to this, than to lay ſtrict injunctions, that his Embaſſadors
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:95405:210"/> for the future, do not contend with yours about precedency? This is the occaſion of the Embaſſie, which I the rather perform, becauſe the Peace lately concluded, is hereby confirmed. May it ſtand in full force to all Generations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King receiving ſatisfaction in his due honour, gave him a nod when he had concluded his ſpeech. He adviſed the Embaſſadors to be mindful of what had paſſed, and to report to their reſpective Princes what they had ſeen and heard.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Dunkirk</hi> by contract is delivered up by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> into the hands of the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Book had been publiſhed, entituled, The Journal of <hi>Monſieur de St. Amour,</hi> D. of <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> containing a full account of all the Tranſactions both in <hi>France</hi> and at <hi>Rome,</hi> concerning the five famous Propoſitions contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted between the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> and the <hi>Moliniſts,</hi> from the year 1646. till 1653. and an addition was made to this Journal in the year 1662. The ſame year the King by Proclamation commanded the Tenets of the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> condemned by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> X. and <hi>Alexander</hi> VII.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Franc.

The <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> received their denomination from <hi>Cornelius Janſen</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ypres,</hi> who about the fortieth year of his Age put out a Book about Grace and Free-will.</p>
               <p>About this time an affront is offered unto <hi>Crequi</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor at <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Corſi</hi> (the Soldiers that are the Popes Guard) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pretence of ſome trivial quarrel with <hi>Crequi</hi>'s Pages, ſhoot Piſtolls in at his windows, ſet upon his Wives Coach as ſhe is coming home, and offer all ſorts of injuries, trampling upon the Sacredneſs of the Embaſſy. <hi>Crequi</hi> departeth from <hi>Rome</hi> unſatisfied, and the <hi>Corſi</hi> triumph.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the King his Maſter applyeth himſelf to the Colledge of Cardinals for redreſs; and his Letter was exactly as followeth.</p>

               <p>The next morning the Nuntio diſpatched it to <hi>Monſieur Lion,</hi> with a Billet of his own, deſiring him to preſent this Breve to his Majeſty, to give him an account of the reſt, and to prevail that the Nuntio might be admitted, to ſpeak with him himſelf. <hi>Monſieur de Lion</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Billet, carried both the one and the other to his Majeſty, expecting what he would command. After he had read the Breve to his Majeſty, he return'd him this anſwer, That he ſhould read the reſt of the diſpatch that day to the King. And accordingly he appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:95405:212"/> a Conference with the Nuntio at <hi>Turenne,</hi> whither the Nuntio paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſame night attended with forty Muſquetiers.</p>
               <p>The Conference was long, the Nuntio laying before him, what upon the foundation of truth, reaſon and the paternal inclination of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, was like to appeaſe his Majeſty. The Sieur <hi>de Lion</hi> aſſured the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio, that the King at the reading of the Breve, expreſſed much ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to ſee his Holineſs ſo well diſpoſed to an Accommodation; and at laſt it was concluded, that on <hi>Sunday</hi> 10. of <hi>December,</hi> he ſhould have an anſwer. The Nuntio had intelligence that the Breve being read in Council they began to be appeaſed.</p>
               <p>But at the ſame time a Gentleman arriving from the Duke of <hi>Crequi,</hi> with advice that he was Commanded out of the Popes Territories, incenſed his Majeſty ſo much, That as ſoon as he was gone out of the Council, Orders were diſpatched immediately to the Nuntio to depart that Kingdom the next day. And albeit he ſent another Breve from the Pope, and an anſwer to <hi>de Lion</hi> from himſelf, there was no further Treaty to be had.</p>
               <p>The Letters from the Nuntio to <hi>Lion</hi> and <hi>Teller,</hi> were not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at all. The Nuntio departed under the Conduct of fifty Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers on Horſe-back, twenty five before his Coach, and as many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, not ſuffering him to diſcourſe with any body, forcing him to march ten Leagues a day, and carrying him every night out of the Road, without acquainting him which way he was to paſs. In ten daies time he arrived in <hi>Savoy,</hi> and ſtayed there for ſome time in the <hi>Chambery,</hi> till he could receive further Order from his Holineſs, to whom he had given particular advice of all that had paſſed.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> took into his power <hi>Avignon,</hi> a City of the Popes in <hi>France,</hi> threatens to uſe extremity, and prepares an Army againſt <hi>Italy.</hi> After divers Treaties it was concluded at <hi>Piſa,</hi> That for the appeaſing the Kings wrath, the <hi>Corſi</hi> be perpetually baniſhed from <hi>Rome.</hi> That a Pyramid be built for an everlaſting Monument of the Action. And that a Legate <hi>à Latere</hi> be ſent alſo to the King in ſubmiſſive terms, to give ſatisfaction for the hainouſneſs of the fact. Which was decently performed by Cardinal <hi>Chigi,</hi> the Popes Nephew.</p>
               <p>At the time that accident happened to the Duke of <hi>Crequi</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> among all the Cardinals there was none that ſtuck ſo zealouſly to the <hi>French</hi> party as the Cardinal <hi>de Retz:</hi> to the admiration of every body, that a perſon that had been turn'd out of his Church, and other Benefices, had been impriſoned, perſecuted, and baniſhed, ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with ſuch ardour in the defence of that intereſt that was the cauſe of his troubles: and (which is worſe) reſolved never to re-admit him to the Dignities he had loſt. The King of <hi>France</hi> unwilling to let the conſtancy or generoſit, of <hi>de Retz,</hi> with which he maintained
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:95405:213"/> the juſt priviledges of his Crown, to go unrewarded, he admitted him again into his favour, which he enjoyes to this day (if he be yet liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) but with ſome conditional limitations, as retaining ſtill in his mind the prejudice he did formerly to the Crown, though he often declared, that all his deſigns were againſt <hi>Mazarine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards <hi>Carlo Roberti</hi> a <hi>Roman,</hi> was created Nuntio, and ſent into <hi>France.</hi> And though the groſs of the quarrel forementioned was compoſed by the Treaty at <hi>Piſa,</hi> yet there were certain reliques remaining, that without good managing might have unravelled all again. Therefore above all the Pope gave <hi>Roberti</hi> in charge, that he ſhould (as much as in him lay) redintegrate into the favour of his Majeſty, and the principal Officers in his Court the opinion that <hi>Chigi</hi> had loſt in <hi>France;</hi> and that he ſhould endeavour to make them appear inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and full of affection for that Crown. Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> VII. in his laſt promotion made him a Cardinal with the reſt of the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio's, and ſent him his Cap to <hi>Paris.</hi> Before his Nuntiature into <hi>France,</hi> this Prelate, was much inclined to the Intereſt of <hi>Spain:</hi> but when he began to be acquainted with the <hi>French</hi> Kings entertainment, and the civility of the <hi>French</hi> Court, he changed his mind, and followed the humour of the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards certain Jeſuites diſobliged by ſome check which they had received in <hi>Paris</hi> about the Jeſuite <hi>Anthony Sancterelli</hi>'s Book, <hi>de Haereſi, Schiſmate, Apoſtaſia</hi> (in which he ſpake to the diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the power of Princes, but magnified and exalted the power and Authority of the Pope) fell publickly to maintain before the Kings face the queſtion of the Infallibility and inpeccability of the Pope.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Divines thought themſelves concern'd for the honour of the Crown, and conſervation of the antient priviledges of their Church, to anſwer them with a moſt juſt and well-grounded Cenſure, wherewith they rigorouſly condemned the doctrine of the Jeſuites, as too remote from the general opinion, and of great prejudice to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of Princes.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> VII. having notice of what paſſed, teſtified to King <hi>Lewes,</hi> his diſlike of this proceeding. The King recommending the examination of the matter to the wiſdom of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> they upon mature deliberation concluded, that the Popes <hi>Infallibility</hi> was not to be admitted in <hi>France,</hi> as being an innovation, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the antient priviledge of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſaw no reaſon to admit a new opinion, known only to ſuch as depended on the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and reject that which was of greater antiquity, and had been owned by ſo many Popes. Which determination ſo netled his Holineſs, that he fell immediately to his
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:95405:213"/> Bulls, and with great threatning and curſes forbad the Printing or read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the aboveſaid Cenſures.</p>
               <p>Among other expreſſions in his Bull, there were theſe, <hi>Praefatas cenſuras uti praeſumptuoſas, temerarias atque ſcandaloſas.</hi> It was very well known, that thoſe Cenſures were made by the <hi>Sorboniſts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Il Cardinaliſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo.</note> the King's principal Divines, by the Parliament it ſelf; which is as much as to ſay, by the King himſelf. Notwithſtanding the Pope ſpares not any revilings, but throws forth peals of invectives indiſcriminately, as if from a Pope nothing is injurious. This is the reſpect the Popes bear to the moſt Chriſtian King, and to ſuch a State as <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lewes</hi> Duke of <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> man, is deſcended from a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Son of King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. who Marrying with <hi>Frances</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> Dutcheſs of <hi>Mercoeur,</hi> had this <hi>Lewes</hi> by her. He had no great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to the Eccleſiaſtical habit, his mind running more after Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, and the affairs of the world. Accordingly when he arrived at a competent Age, he Married a Niece of Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi>'s, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping by means of his favour to open a way to ſome honourable employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This Lady lived not many years with the Duke her Husband, to whom ſhe left two hopeful Sons.</p>
               <p>This Lord being a Widdower, changeth his mind, being now alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for the Eccleſiaſtical habit; not in any penitential way, but only to capacitate him for the Cardinalſhip, which he alwaies aim'd at. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, the <hi>French</hi> King according to the Prerogative of his Crown, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to nominate a perſon in the laſt promotion of Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> preſented this as a perſon of great Merit, and fit to be an Ornament both to the Cap and Colledge: and the rather becauſe in his Viceroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and in his Government of <hi>Provence,</hi> he had ſhewed great diligence in his Majeſties ſervice.</p>
               <p>A few daies after he had received his Cap, the tidings of the Popes languiſhing condition arrived: ſo that with directions from the King, he parted immediately for <hi>Rome,</hi> to be preſent at the new Conclave, where he met exactly with all the reſt of the <hi>French</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals.</p>
               <p>In the year 1667. Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> VII. dieth, and <hi>Clement</hi> IX, ſucceedeth him. The Election being made, the Cardinal of <hi>Vendoſm</hi> (who in this Conclave had behaved himſelf with great prudence, and perhaps more than was expected by the elder Cardinals, that had been a long time acquainted with the Intrigues of the Conclaves) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for his return into <hi>France:</hi> but firſt he recommended to his Holineſs the Intereſts of his Maſter, particularly in the buſineſs of the diſcameration of <hi>Caſtro,</hi> according to the Treaty at <hi>Piſa,</hi> in which it was Articled, that <hi>Caſtro</hi> ſhould be delivered. The Pope ſent a Bull to Cardinal <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> declaring him Legate <hi>à Latere,</hi> and thereby qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying him for that Function.</p>

                  <head>Here followeth a Relation of the Preſent Eſtate of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches in <hi>France,</hi> tranſlated out of <hi>French,</hi> and publiſhed <hi>Anno 1668.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>I Shall only in brief relate the proceedings of the Adverſe party againſt them.</p>
                  <p>The firſt and moſt conſiderable Mean uſed againſt them by the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Clergy is that of Commiſſions.</p>
                  <p>For under pretext of executing the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees made in conſequence thereof, and providing againſt the breaches of the ſame, they have engaged the King to ſend Commiſſioners into all Provinces. For clearing whereof, we muſt remember that <hi>Henry</hi> IV. of happy memory, having found it convenient (for the quiet of his Subjctes) to make this Edict as a particular and irrevocable Law, did ſend Commiſſioners into all the Provinces to execute the ſame, and after thoſe Commiſſioners had eſtabliſhed all things in due form, they returned their Executions into the hands of the King, to ſerve as a Rule in all future debates, which could ariſe on that ſubject.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Commiſſioners (although the <hi>Hugonots</hi> have uſurped nothing ſince the firſt execution of the Edict, but on the contrary have ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed innumerable loſſes) have now altogether perverted the buſineſs: for concealing the firſt execution of the Edict, they have compelled all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches within the Kingdom to appear before thoſe Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and to reproduce their Titles, to verifie their Right for the publick Exerciſe of their Religion, and to be judged a ſecond time, as if the Edict had never been put in execution. And albeit particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches produce Acts made in their favours by the firſt Commiſſioners (Executors of the Edict) yet thoſe new Commiſſioners without any regard thereof reject the ſame as utterly invalid.</p>
                  <p>The Council paſt an Act <hi>Anno</hi> 1662. by which it was Ordained, That the Proteſtants ſhall not be admitted before the Commiſſioners to prove the Rights for the Exerciſe of their Religion by Inqueſts or Witneſſes, even although the Witneſſes be <hi>Roman</hi> Catholiques. Now, beſide that this manner of probation was never rejected, yet are they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the only Mean which in moſt places is left them to juſtifie their Titles. For during the late Wars, many Churches being pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laged or burnt, they cannot otherwiſe evidence their poſſeſſion, than by the teſtimony of Ancient men yet alive, who can depoſe the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherein Affairs ſtood in the years 1596. and 1597.</p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:95405:214"/>
                  <p>Moreover, each Province hath two Commiſſioners, one a Papiſt, the other a Proteſtant. And from the Popiſh Commiſſioners what ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice can they expect? They (in effect) proceed according to the inſtructions of <hi>Menier</hi> the Jeſuite, who hath Printed a Book, wherein faſtning impertinent Expoſitions upon the plaineſt terms of the Edict, and changing his Majeſties Authentick and Royal Words into Jeſuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Equivocations, he hath perverted all things according to his own inclination. So that their ſtrongeſt reaſons are ſcorned, and their beſt Titles rejected as Trifles, whilſt the falſe Allegations of their Adverſaries are admitted as the beſt of Arguments. And they condemn ſome Churches, which produce the like and much better Titles, than thoſe alledged by ſome other Churches, whoſe Priviledges they have ratified.</p>
                  <p>And for the Proteſtant Commiſſioners, what juſtice or protection can they expect from them, becauſe the greateſt part of them are choſen by direction and recommendation of the Popiſh Prelates. And ſome of thoſe Commiſſioners have parted, or ſhared the places of Publick Worſhip between the Papiſts and the Proteſtants. And this ſharing of Churches is alwaies determined in Council, by advice of the Popiſh Commiſſioners, their Proteſtant Colleagues being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver either called or heard; and hereupon the <hi>Hugonots</hi> have loſt three parts of four of all their Churches. And a multitude of Acts have been publiſhed by the Council, which have been very grievous to them.</p>
                  <p>One Act hath bereaved them of the liberty of praiſing God,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>May</hi> 6. 1659. and <hi>March</hi> 17. 1661.</note> by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding the ſinging of Pſalms, even privately in their houſes, though it be an eminent part of Chriſtian Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>Another Act compelleth them to bury their dead clandeſtinely,<note place="margin">

                  <p>They ſeem alſo to forbid them all hope of being heard in their own defence. And there is little hope of being heard at the Council it ſelf, where all their Affairs have their laſt Appeal and audience. For it hath often come to paſs, that the Proteſtant Deputies ſent by the Provinces and Cities to plead their Cauſe, have been expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to return, without ſo much as only liberty to appear.

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:95405:215"/> pleaſe: and they vex them ſo, to the end no man may be willing to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the calling of a Miniſter.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Cities where Proteſtants for number are moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, ſeem to be the principal Object of their Enemies fury. Of theſe <hi>Montauban, Rochel,</hi> and <hi>Milan,</hi> (formerly three flouriſhing Cities) are now brought very low, and expoſed to ſufferings of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers kinds.</p>
                  <p>Their Adverſaries vex them alſo with Civil and Criminal Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, as well againſt the Body of their Church, as particular perſons, ſometimes in the name of the Kings General Atturneys, or their Subſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes: ſometime in the name of <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> or <hi>Monaſtick</hi> Attorneys, or their Chapters: and all this frequently for things utterly falſe; as that they have ſpoken irreverently of the Sacraments, or ſuch like groſs impoſtures: for proving of all which, they never want ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and falſe witneſſes. And if at any time the Forgery be diſcovered, the Judges ſeldom puniſh the Authours: or if they inflict any puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all, it is but ſuch as through the ſlightneſs thereof, giveth greater liberty and encouragement to ſuch perſons; whereof there are many notorious Inſtances.</p>
                  <p>A liberty is alſo granted to Prieſts and Monks (whoſe nature with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out encouragement is forward enough) to inſult over the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> to commit all manner of violence without fear of puniſhment, yea and to execute the conciliary Acts againſt them, as they have done in <hi>Poictou,</hi> where the Prieſts have in divers places demoliſhed Churches, digged up and ſearched the very loweſt ſtones of the foundation, broke open Cheſts, carried away the poors moneys, pulled down particular mens houſes, and the Caſtles of the Proteſtant Gentry, abuſing them with injurious words and moſt violent actions.</p>
                  <p>They alſo take ſtrange waies to make Proſelytes: for neglecting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and good example (which are the only proper and lawful means of gaining ſouls to God) they only uſe promiſes, threatnings, and labour to catch men by divers kinds of ſnares.</p>
                  <p>They alſo deprive the <hi>Hugonots</hi> of all means of acquiring a Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and all hopes of preferment, there being no admittance of them into any publick Office (except thoſe of the Chambers of the Edict) no, not ſo much as to the petty Offices of a Notary, Attorney, or Serjeant, nor yet to learn Arts and Trades.</p>
                  <p>The Relator concludes thus; Unleſs we be wilfully blind, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſee, that they deſign to drive us (by deſpair) into ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. But that we ſhall never do; preferring rather to ſuffer the greateſt extremity, and our very blood to be ſhed, than in the leaſt to violate the reſpect which we owe to our Prince. And if they cannot overcome our Patience (as aſſuredly they never
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:95405:216"/> ſhall) then their Reſolution is, by continual importunity to prevail with his Majeſty to drive us out of the Kingdom. But we hope the King is ſo good and juſt, that he will never gratifie them in ſuch a thing without a Parallel. And if we ſhould be called to ſuch a Trial, we hope God will give us ſuch ſtrength and courage, as without Regret to abandon our native Land, that we may ſerve Him, where-ever his Providence ſhall call us. And this in effect is the general reſolution of all the PROTESTANTS within the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Since the writing the precedent Relation, which is but an Epitome of ſome of the Principal matters tranſlated out of <hi>French,</hi> and Printed by <hi>A. Maxwell, Anno</hi> 1668. there lately came to my hands a Pamphlet, which containeth a Narrative of the preſent deplorable eſtate of the Proteſtants in <hi>France,</hi> which declareth (among divers other things) the proceeding of the Parliament at <hi>Roven,</hi> againſt the Lady <hi>Bauroger</hi> and her Daughters, and Mr. <hi>Le Moine</hi> Paſtor of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Church at <hi>Roven,</hi> occaſioned by the flight of <hi>Madamoiſelle Darques</hi> out of <hi>France</hi> into <hi>England.</hi> I ſhall refer the Reader for fuller ſatisfaction therein to the foreſaid Narrative, lately Printed at <hi>London.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. They ſet down a form of Profeſſion of faith. I <hi>N.</hi> do with firm faith believe and profeſs all and every thing which is contained in the ſymbol of faith, which the holy Roman Church uſeth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Concluding
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:95405:220"/> thus: And I moſt firmly believe and embrace the Apoſtolick and Eccleſiaſtical Traditions, and the reſt of the obſervations and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the ſame Church. <hi>Item,</hi> I admit the holy Scripture, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that ſence which our holy Mother the Church hath held and holdeth, whoſe right it is to judge of the true ſence and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the holy Scriptures: neither will I ever receive and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it but according to the unanimous conſent of the Fathers. I alſo profeſs, that there are ſeven ſacraments of the new Law, inſtituted by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſm, Confirmation, the Euchariſt, Penance, Extream Unction, Order, and Matrimony, and that they do confer grace: and of theſe, that Baptiſm, Confirmation, and Order, cannot be reiterated without ſacriledge. And I receive and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the received and approved rites of the Catholick Church in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn adminiſtration of all the foreſaid Sacraments. I embrace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all and every thing which have been defined and declared in the holy Council of <hi>Trent</hi> concerning Original ſin and Juſtification. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I profeſs, that there is offered up unto God in the Maſs, a true, proper, and propitiatory Sacrifice for quick and dead, and that in the moſt holy Sacrament of the Euchariſt, there is truly, really, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially, the body and blood, together with the Soul and Divinity of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and that there is made a converſion of the whole ſubſtance of the Bread into the Body, and of the whole ſubſtance of the Wine into the Blood. Which converſion the Catholick Church calleth <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> I confeſs alſo that under one kind only whole Chriſt, and the true Sacrament is received. I conſtantly hold, that there is a Purgatory, and that the ſouls detained there are helped by the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages of the faithful. Likewiſe, that the Saints reigning together with Chriſt, are to be Worſhipped and called upon, and that they do offer up prayers to God for us. And I aſſert, that their Relicks are to be Worſhipped. That the Images of Chriſt, and the Mother of God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a Virgin, and alſo of other Saints, are to be had and retained, and that due honour, and veneration is to be given to them. And I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that the power of Indulgences was left by Chriſt in the Church, and that the uſe of them is very comfortable to Chriſtian people. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that the holy Catholick, and Apoſtolick Roman Church, is the Mother and Miſtreſs of all Churches. And I freely promiſe and ſwear true obedience to the Roman Biſhop, the Succeſſour of the bleſſed <hi>Peter,</hi> the Prince of the Apoſtles, the Succeſſour of Jeſus Chriſt. And I undoubtedly receive and profeſs all other things deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the Sacred, Canonical, and Oecumenical Councils, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the holy Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> Moreover I condemn, reject, and anathematize all contrary things, and hereſies whatſoever condemned, rejected, and anathematized by the Church. And this Catholick faith, without which no man can be ſaved, which I freely profeſs, and truly
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:95405:220"/> hold for the preſent, the ſame I will retain, and profeſs conſtantly unto the end of my life by the help of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this I promiſe, vow, and ſwear, ſo help me God, and his holy Goſpels.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>OF the Houſes of a Seminary.]</hi> That they be built in a large and ſpacious place, near unto the Cathedral Church. That there be a Chappel wherein the Clergy may meet at prayers. That the dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitory be open and common, in which every one may have his own bed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That an Hoſpital be appointed in an open place for ſick folks, in which all things may be provided for the ſick, with ſingular piety and charity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Of the manner of admitting Clerks into Seminaries.]</hi> The ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and admiſſion of Clerks ſhall be in the power of the Biſhop: or of thoſe to whom this care ſhall be committed by name. That out of all youths very fit youths may be choſen, the Biſhop ſhall cauſe it to be proclaimed through all the Cities and Towns of the Dioceſs (eſpecially where there are Schools) that if any be poor, and born of lawful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, who deſire to be promoted to the Prieſthood, and who have attained to the age of twelve years, and have not exceeded the twentieth, and have made ſome progreſs in the Grammar, that they appear to be examined at the time and place which he ſhall appoint them. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop ſhall not admit any to be examined, whom he ſhall behold to be maimed, or deformed. Then ſhall he enquire diligently concerning the condition, eſtate, manners, and religion of the Parents. And he ſhall try what progreſs the youths have made in learning, he ſhall alſo have regard to their wit, vertue, and diſpoſition either to good or evil. And whom by manifeſt conjectures he ſhall judge to be unfit for learning, piety, and the Prieſthood, he ſhall by no means admit into the Seminary. Before any one be admitted into the Seminary, he is to be often admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, that he may not be educated and nouriſhed in the Seminary, if he propound to himſelf any other kind of life, than an Eccleſiaſtical life. Therefore let him by oath, vow, and holily promiſe, that he will never depart to any other courſe of life, but will alwayes faithfully
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:95405:222"/> ſerve the Church of Chriſt in that degree and order which ſhall be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to him by the Biſhop. He ſhall alſo promiſe to obey the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Seminary, and his Subſtitutes in all things, and that he will obſerve all the Laws and Statutes of the Seminary, which ſhall be read unto him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let none be received till he be inſtructed concerning his Bed, Gown, Cap, Waſtecoat, and other Garments, Surplice and Breviary.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Of the Preſident, and Overſeers of a Seminary.]</hi> None are to be admitted into any Office in a Seminary, unleſs he be firſt diligently examined and tryed by the Biſhop. Great care ſhall be taken, that the Governours of a Seminary be men grave, prudent, and adorned with all kind of vertue, who by their example and exhortations may provoke thoſe that are under their charge to the ſtudy of Piety and Vertue. Let all firſt put the confeſſion of their faith, according to the form ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Provincial Council, in the hands of the Biſhop. In the Seminary there ſhall be one Preſident of venerable gravity, and a Prieſt of ſingular piety, whom all in the Seminary ſhall obey, as well in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals as Temporals. And to the Preſident two other Prieſts ſhall be joyned, whereof one ſhall be an Overſeer of all buſineſſes of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary: the other ſhall have the care of the houſhold affairs, and ſhall be called the Under-Maſter of the Seminary. In the Seminary ſhall be ſo many ſervants as the Biſhop, or thoſe delegated by him ſhall think fit. The Governours of the Seminary ſhall diligently require of their Scholars a repetition of the Lecture, and direct them in their manners and behaviour. And one of them ſhall teach the Clerks an Eccleſiaſtical Song. Let the Preſident be daily in the Seminary, and with his preſence and care contain all in their duty: and to the Biſhop let him often give an account of the whole Seminary. Let the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent have a Book in which he may ſet down the names, ſirnames, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the day and year of the reception of all thoſe who ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Seminary, and whatſoever houſhold-ſtuff every one ſhall bring.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Of the Oeconomy, or Houſhold-Government of the Seminary.]</hi> A skilful Procurator ſhall be ſet over the houſe in temporal matters, who ſhall take care of affairs at home and abroad: he ſhall gather in time all the yearly rents and profits of the Seminary: and the moneys collected he ſhall ſtraightway deliver to the Preſident to be kept in a cheſt. And he ſhall have a Book, in which he ſhall diligently and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet down, whatſoever profits and moneys he ſhall receive, and of whom, and for what cauſe, and ſhall note the day, the month and the year. He ſhall give an account to the Preſident of what he receiveth and expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every month: and the Preſident ſhall ſign the book of accounts with his own hand: and the ſame accounts ſhall the Biſhop examine every third month, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He that ſhall buy in food and other things, ſhall be
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:95405:222"/> one that is found to be a man faithful and conſcientious, who ſhall every day receive ſo much money as is neceſſary from the Procurator, and every day give an account to the Procurator of what is received and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, and that particularly and by piece-meal. The houſhold-ſtuff, and all the ſeveral Veſſels and Inſtruments of the Seminary, ſhall the Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator ſet down in a Book, and ſhall give an account of them to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour in the ſixth month. Moderate food, frugal, and not very deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, ſhall be deſcribed by the Biſhop and his Delegates.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Of the Diſcipline of the Seminary: and firſt of Piety.]</hi> Let the Clerks be excited to Piety and Religion. Let every one be raiſed up at four a clock in the morning, then let them come together in one place, and with bended knees apply themſelves to Prayer for half an hour, and they ſhall rehearſe (one going before, others anſwering with a clear voice) the hourly prayers of the bleſſed Virgin. They who ſhall be ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated to ſacred orders, ſhall recite the Breviary in convenient time, and with great attention. Before nine a clock in the evening, before they lye down to reſt, they ſhall all together rehearſe the Litanies, and by and by ſhall ſearch and examine their conſciences <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Every month ſhall every one confeſs his ſins to the Prieſt: and being prepared let them receive the holy Euchariſt with great devotion, unleſs their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor ſee cauſe to with-hold it from them. Every holy day going out two by two out of the Seminary, and putting on their Surplices, let them come together to the greater Maſs, and Veſpers, of the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral-church of the City, in which the Seminary ſhall be, and there let them ſtand and ſit in places appointed for them, and ſing with the Quire; and on thoſe days they ſhall be preſent at the publick Sermon in the ſame Church, or another place. The Preſident alſo ſhall diverſe times in every month give brief exhortations to the Clergy concerning the dignity of Vertues, and the filthineſs of Vices, with the remedies thereof, concerning bleſſedneſs, the pains of Hell, concerning death, the laſt judgement. In the beginning of Dinner and Supper one of the Prieſts ſhall pray for a bleſſing, and give thanks after Supper or Dinner, all modeſtly anſwering the Prieſt going before them. The Pſalm <hi>de pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundis, &amp;c.</hi> is to be added, and other Collects for the Founder and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors. In the time of Dinner and Supper let one read by ſuggeſtion ſome Chapter out of the holy Bible, to which may be added the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome pious Book, which they ſhall all diligently hear, that whilſt the body is refreſhed with food, the mind may never be idle. Among other Writings of Pious and Learned men, let them often read privately and publickly that famous Epiſtle of S. <hi>Hierom</hi> to <hi>Nepotian, de Vita Clericorum,</hi> that unto that Rule every one may endeavour to direct himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Of obedience, and other duties of the Clerks of the Seminary.]</hi> The Clerks of the Seminary are to be obedient to their Governours in
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:95405:223"/> all things. Let none go out of the Colledge without leave, and a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion joyned to him, with whom let him alſo return back again into the Seminary. Let none ſend or otherwiſe receive Letters, unleſs by the hand of the Preſident, who ſhall diligently read them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> None ſhall eat with any one without the Seminary, unleſs with his Parents and Kindred, and that very ſeldome, and with leave; neither ſhall he ſleep out of the Seminary. If any go forth, and abide without, the Preſident being ignorant of it, he may not be admitted without conſulting the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, whoſe right it is to appoint, whether he be to be received into the Seminary or not. Let none touch another ſo much as in jeſt, but every where and among all preſerve modeſty and gravity. Let ſilence every where be kept religiouſly, in the Temple, in the Schools, in the Chamber, between going to and returning from the School, and in all places let Eccleſiaſtical modeſty appear. They ſhall not diſcourſe with thoſe they meet, except by decent and modeſt ſalutation, which may be done in paſſing by. As often as they ſhall go either to the Temple or the School, they ſhall proceed modeſtly two by two, their Governour following them to whom they are committed. When they are at ſtudy, let none ſpeak with other, neither in the morning before, nor in the evening after prayer. All ſhall go to bed at nine a clock, and riſe at four: all ſhall lye ſingle in their beds, that they may preſerve their health. After Dinner, and after Supper, they ſhall ſpend one hour in honeſt recreation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let them keep their clothes, chambers, beds, books, clean: let them make up their beds early in the morning.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Of their Learning.</hi>] Let all firſt learn the Compendium of the Catholick Catechiſm ſo exactly, that by mutual interrogations concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, they may be able to render an account of the Catholick Faith to every one requiring it. And to that end a repetition of it ſhall be made twice in a Week. And when they ſhall be advanced herein, let the reading of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catechiſm be diligently commended to them, that from thence they may learn the higher Doctrine of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Let them alwayes keep the Law of ſpeaking Latin, and let them be diligent in learning their leſſons, and getting them by heart in the time prefixed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let none be abſent from School in the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time. In the School, let the Clerks who ſhall be of the ſame form, ſit together, and endeavour to excel others with all modeſty. Let them neither buy nor have any Books, but thoſe whom the Preſident ſhall judge to be profitable for them. Books that are condemned by the holy Apoſtolical Chair, and immodeſt Books, let them not ſo much as know them by name, much leſs let them dare ever to read them. They ſhall be exerciſed in all kind of Diſciplines, which do eſpecially help to the knowledge of Divinity, and when they ſhall learn more humane Learning and Philoſophy, they are to be chiefly inſtructed in that part of Divinity which unfoldeth caſes of conſcience. Let them alſo learn Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:95405:223"/> Books diligently, and thoſe which they call Ritual. Let all be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in their order in making Orations and Exhortations concerning the commandments of God and of the Church, concerning the Articles of faith, Vertues to be followed, and Vices to be ſhunned, or ſome other ſentence of Scripture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Of Correction.</hi>] If any be wayward, and ſawcy, eſpecially who infect and corrupt the manners of others, all endeavours are to be uſed, leſt they bring any detriment to the Seminary, if the Moderators are ſomewhat indulgent toward them: neither are they who are of a crabbed nature long to be retained in the Seminary, unleſs they ſhall reform them by words or correction. As they are not to be born in a Seminary, who are ignorant and ſlothful, ſo much leſs they who neglect piety, who vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Statutes of the Seminary, who enter into ſociety with diſſolute perſons, who are delighted in the diſcourſes of thoſe that are without, who are wont to whiſper and backbite, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who art wont to lye, and excuſe their own faults, who impatiently bear puniſhments injoyned, who ſpeak or anſwer malapertly, undecently, or ironically. Theſe and the like Vices are firſt of all to be ſtopt by the whole Seminary, and ſharply to be corrected, without excepting any.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Of the reaſon of promoting Clerks, and diſmiſſing them from the Seminary. As often as Orders ſhall be celebrated, the Preſident ſhall give to the Biſhop a Catalogue of thoſe, who for their age, piety, and learning, may be promoted to ſome Order.</p>
                  <p>In examinations which ſhall be had to vacant Benefices, the Seminary-Clerks if they be fit, let them be preferred before all others. They ſhall be ſent at the pleaſure of the Biſhop to Churches deſtitute of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, or to govern Schools, or to undergo other Eccleſiaſtical Offices, for the neceſſity of times and places. Whoſoever ſhall be ſent away from the Seminary, (for what cauſe ſoever) let him render an account of his Office to the Preſident, which he hath exerciſed at home, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore all things to its place which have been committed to him.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who have been educated in the Seminary, and without the licence of the Biſhop have delivered up themſelves to any place or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or have fled out of the Dioceſs in which they ought to ſerve the Church, ſhall be bound to make reſtitution of that maintenance which they have received in the Seminary. They who depart, if they come to better preferment, yet are they to remember that they ought to be beneficial and grateful to the Seminary. Departing, let them take their leave of the Lord Biſhop, if he be in the City, his Vicars, the Preſident, the Prieſts, and the reſt of their companions, and let them ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly entreat them all to pray for their proſperity.</p>
